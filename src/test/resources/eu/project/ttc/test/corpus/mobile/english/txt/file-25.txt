We would also like to thank Xiaoyu Wang, 
our counselor advisor for always being in the

appreciate your suggestions when we got stuck

Thank you to all the counselors for staying 
up late at night and making us sleep. You've given us 
an opportunity to spend the summer with awesome 
people from around New Jersey. We know summers 
are hard to come by and we're glad you're taking the 
time to spend it with Governor's School.
Thank you to Anthony Welch, Dean Brown, 
and Eileen ____? Along with the other coordinators 
for getting sponsors and working with Rutgers to 
keep this program running Without you, there 
wouldn't be a program this year for us to go to.
Thank you to the Governor's School 
program of New Jersey for starting the program in 
the beginning. It is a very enriching program that all 
of us can say we've learned something new about 
engineering and about other people.
Thank you to all our friends, family, and 
teachers for being there for us and supporting us. 
Classes were stimulating and taught us so many new 
things. Thanks to our families for driving us to the 
program and encouraging us to learn. Without our 
families, we would not have had such a hunger for 
knowledge.
And of course, thank you to all our other
