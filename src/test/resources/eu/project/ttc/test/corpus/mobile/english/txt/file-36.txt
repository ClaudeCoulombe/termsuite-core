Bernhard H. Walke, Ian Herwono, Ralf Pabst

Abstract A new service concept for a mobile broadband system called the Wireless Media System (WMS) is introduced. The WMS will provide broadband access to terminals with medium velocity of movement and is embedded into a cellular radio network to support a high velocity of terminals with medium transmission rate. An Intelligent Service Control and advanced radio resource management for a power-optimized exploitation of multiple air interfaces will provide a virtually continuous radio connectivity to the WMS although the physical radio connectivity might be discontinuous. Broadcast, multicast and single-cast services will be combined to minimize the number of transmissions needed to provide the contents requested by the users. The concept of the Intelligent Service Control as well as basic service concepts and multimedia applications and usage scenarios are presented.

Abstract MCRL (Mobile Communication Research Laboratory) With increasing end user demands for wider service due to the rapid growth and variety of IT  (information technology) industry, the service with
the data rate of 30Mbps cannot accommodate the future mobile multimedia environment. Therefore,  worldwide radio and mobile communication institutes and companies started the R & D of 4G mobile communications system prior to completing the implementation of IMT-2000 system and providing its service. ETRI is one of those
organizations endeavoring for the future 4G system with capabilities beyond IMT-2000. With the establishment of R&D project for 4G radio
transmission system in January of 2002, ETRI is actively working to develop 4G high-tier system,  HMM(High-speed Mobile Multi-media), and 4G low-tier systems, HMI(High-speed Mobile Internet), and HPi(High-speed Portable Internet). In this paper, ETRI's 4G vision and enabling technologies to achieve this vision is described.

Abstract?Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS), which supports all types of switching, can provide next-generation mobile broadband IP networks with quality of service (QoS) and traffic engineering (TE). Future core network of wireless mobile system will be GMPLS-based wired IP networks; GMPLS must provide an efficient scheme to support micro-mobility in wireless environment. The purpose of this paper is to propose a scheme of integrating GMPLS with micro-mobility for the next-generation mobile broadband IP networks. The proposed scheme can re-establish a label switched path (LSP) rapidly when a mobile node (MN) enters a new subnet. Therefore, low latency performance can be achieved. The resource utilization in GMPLS networks can also be improved.

REDUCING OPTICAL POWER VARIATION IN AMPLIFIED OPTICALNETWORK
Philip J. Lin
Abstract  In an optical network where lightpaths may encounter a chain of Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers  (EDFAs), power non-uniformity is a problem of concern.  Practical EDFAs have non-flat gain profile. Thus, some wavelength channels experience higher gain than other channels. Automatic gain control (AGC) used in EDFA only ensures constant aggregate gain and does not address the non-flat gain shape. The AGC, combined with non -flat EDFA profile, cause the actual per channel gain to vary according to the input power profile. In fact, higher channels will often  "steal":! the available gain from lower power channels. This gain variation, compounded over a cascade chain of amplifiers, translates into received power variation. Together with limited receiver dynamic range, this severely impacts the
lightpath performance and complicates lightpath engineering. Furthermore, the effect of gain variation can propagate from node to node and be exacerbated in a mesh network where lightpaths weaves in and out of each other. This paper analyzes the non -uniform gain problem and shows that even under the worst-case situation, the gain variati on is bounded.  As a result, simple engineering rules are adequate to ensure the performance of a lightpaths even in a dynamic
environment. Furthermore, this paper suggests a novel preemphasis scheme. Appropriately de-emphasizing the strong wavelength channels and emphasizing the weak channels at the light path origins can reduce the power fluctuation at the receivers. This will allow the lightpath to traverse a larger number of EDFAs before regeneration is needed.

Wavelength Converter Management in All-optical
Networks with Arbitrary Topologies Using Abstracting
Techniques1
Ding Zhemin and Mounir Hamdi

Abstract Previous works have shown the wavelength conversion can considerably reduce the blocking probability in all-optical networks, but most of analytical models and algorithms are proposed under simplifying assumptions or restricted to specific cases. In this paper, we first introduce an abstracting technique called Blocking Island (BI) paradigm. A Blocking Island Hierarchy (BIH) can be constructed by using the BI paradigm and bottleneck links can be easily identified in BIH. We then propose the wavelength placement algorithms using this
abstracting technique both in static traffic case and dynamic traffic case. To make sure our algorithm is applicable in arbitrary topologies and any incoming traffic patterns, a simulation-based optimization approach is employed. In the simulation, we show the performance improvement obtained by full wavelength conversion can almost be achieved by using limited number of wavelength converters with careful placement. In a random generated network topology, we demonstrate our algorithm outperforms the best existing allocation scheme.

A Enhanced Service Management Architecture for the NGN
Xianxin Jiang, Fangchun Yang, Hua Zou
Abstract Future multi-service networks will be extremely large and complex. The management of a service can be divided into two parts, the service independent part and service specified part. It is difficult to manage the service specified part of every service in a same way, but it is possible to reuse some management functions to manage the service independent part of every service. This paper represents an enhanced service management architecture (ESMA) in which all services of the next generation networks (NGN) can be managed in the same way by reusing the same service management functions. In ESMA focus are on the service independent management functions. This paper discusses these service management functions and gives a architecture to organize them.

Abstract--Because there are a lot of the self-similarity phenomena was found in communication system, many researchers doing work on this field. Experimental evidence for self-similarity in various types of data network traffic is already overwhelming and continues to grow. In this paper,  we point out that Internet traffic has self-similarity using actual trace in ChinaNet. Then we propose the result that essential reason of fractal characteristics is the existing of restricting mechanism and attractor in telecommunication systems. In the research of network traffic trace, we cited the fractal theory and explain the reasons of self-similarity property of traffic in telecommunication network and longrange dependent from vary aspect. One viewpoint is proposed that the fractal structure of telecommunication network shows the attraction and dissipation energy of long-term trend in systems, which extends the meaning of the original fractal theory.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF A NOVEL OPTICAL NETWORKARCHITECTURE --PETAWEB
Aimin Huang, Ognian Kabranov, Dimitrios Makrakis

Abstract-- The dramatic increase of Internet users and the development of new high volume Internet applications has a profound impact on the design of next generation optical network (NGON) architectures. In order to cope with the immense diversity of applications and traffic volume, highly dynamic optical networks will be needed. PetaWeb, proposed by Nortel Networks, is based on the use of adaptive core and edge switches, which can accommodate traffic fluctuations through periodic reconfiguration of channels. This increases the effective capacity of the network, reduces delay and delay jitter. We implement a simulation model of the PetaWeb architecture, verify the functionality of the PetaWeb and quantify its performance. Extensive simulation results are presented to quantify the benefits of agility. We have performed a thorough analysis how performance related parameters are affected by several factors, such as the reconfiguration frequency, the size and number of optical c
 hannels, as well as the buffer size of the edge node.

Fair Bandwidth Allocation for Responsive and Unresponsive Flows
Using a Capture-Recapture Model
Ming-Kit Chan and Mounir Hamdi

Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel technique called CARE (CApture-REcapture fair sharing) to provide fair bandwidth sharing. CARE estimates two network resource parameters:  the number of flows in the buffer and the data source rate of a flow by using a capture-recapture model. The capture-recapture model depends on simply the random capturing/recapturing of the incoming packets, and as a result, it provides a good approximation tool with low time/space complexity. Our experiments and analysis will demonstrate that CARE provides highly accurate fair bandwidth share under different network configurations and outperforms the existing mechanisms.

Network Costing
Sarah Bluhme
Abstract Did you not believe that the use of the internet is free of charge? Here I would like to bring arguments to the contrary and discuss the cost aspect of the internet and the consequences for its anticipated rapid expansion and the increasing burden on the infrastructure as the capacity is stretched. I have four points to make. They all concern the accounting for the costs of the internet. For this purpose resource consumption must be classified and measured.  Accounting can be based on either content or transport.  Content accounting seems to be very complicated, e.g.  based on 1) the value of goods in E-commerce or on 2) disk capacity or processing power or 3) on transport. Here I am only concerned with transport accounting and will first show the costing of the LRZ at Munich.  



A Methodology for Analyzing Backbone Network Traffic at Stream-Level
HE Tao, ZHANG Hui, LI Xing, LI Zhichun


Abstract Most of network traffic analysis studies begin at the fine-grained level, such as packet-level and flow-level.  Based on accurate measurements and complex analysis methods, these studies could not be carried on widely throughout a backbone network. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for analyzing network traffic at the coarsegrained level by incorporating stream information which could be achieved by simple passive monitoring. A careful study of many traffic traces acquired on an international link between two ISPs validates our work.  


An Efficient Algorithm for Designing Optimal Backbone Topology for a Communication Networks
Swarup Mandal1, Debashis Saha2, Rajarshi Mukherjee3, Anandarup Roy4
Abstract In this paper, we present an algorithm to design an optimal backbone network topology, which incorporates some real life constraints of reliability. A network topology is a 1-FT topology if it can survive a single link failure. The problem a designer of network faces is how to find a reliable network topology for a set of nodes with reduced total link cost. The problem is known to be NP-hard i.e. there exists no polynomial time algorithms to solve this problem. Thus, the problem can be formulated as combinatorial optimization problem. Our algorithm, a variant of enumerative technique, tries to find out a 1-FT network topology with optimal total link cost when runs to its termination. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(N4).  We have tested our algorithm for a wide range of data set and compared the outcome with the existing approach based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and found that our algorithm outperforms the GA based approach in producing quality solution.

A Novel Modeling Method for CDMA Network Planning
Jianming Zhang, Dacheng Yang
Abstract For network planning, it's important to investigate a method which can evaluate the system performances given certain system parameters including the direction of the antenna, its down-till angle, power and others.  Because the practical networks are very complex, it's not sufficient to simply use some theoretical formulas. This paper presents a novel modeling method for CDMA network planning applications. The proposed modeling method consists of some iterative linear equations which greatly decrease the complexity of network planning. This paper also proved that the method is completely convergent and the numerical results show the convergence rate is fast. What's more, this method is easy to be implemented on computer platforms and thus can be used as the core algorithm of planning softwares, perspectively.

Active Distributed Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture
Daoying Huang1, 2, Zupeng Li1,Yao Zhang2, Jianhua Huang1

Abstract   The distribution of Gnutella topology nodes (A pure distributed Peer-to-Peer network) exhibits both typical Power-Law and Small-World property, but its original protocol simply use flooding algorithm to query peer's information and not use above property to improve its search efficiency, so it exist poor scalability problem. At the same time, it has the common problem that its querying routing is just implemented on application layer, so the efficiency and performance can not be high. For above reasons, we proposed a new distributed peer-to-peer network model (Active Distributed Peer-to-Peer Network, ADP2PN) by applying active network technology and stratifying the Gnutella network model, and effectively resolve the problem. In this paper, we present the architecture and query routing protocol about ADP2PN model, and analyses its rationality and validity.

A Novel Architecture to Customer Service Management for the NGN
Xianxin Jiang, Fangchun Yang, Hua Zou

Abstract Managing services on the Next Generation Network (NGN) is becoming more and more complex and time consuming for service providers since services are increasing both in number and complexity. Also the number of users per service is going up. A solution to this problem is to allow the service users themselves to partly manage the services they are using. This is called Customer Service Management, and it will both increase the perceived value of the services to the users as well as lower the operational costs of service management for the service provider. This paper presents a architecture for Customer Service Management in NGN.

Wei Yu, Yongmei Cui, Li Hongchang

Abstract--It is imperative for the further study of pricing infrastructures with network characteristics so as to provide positive incentives for the suppliers of concerning services. Economists such as Laffont, Tirole,  etc. developed theories about infrastructure pricing:  SAT (Stand Alone Test), ECPR (Efficient Component Pricing Rule). Especially, Sidak, Spulber, put forward a more practical method for bottleneck infrastructures of gas, railway, telecommunication. This method is called as M-ECPR (Market Efficient Component Pricing Rule)  on the basis of opportunity cost. In this article, we bring the M-ECPR principles into the study of Chinese railways pricing of its network infrastructures.  Combined with our Engineer Model and Opportunity Cost Model we analyzed the special conditions faced by Chinese railways, and developed a model for sharing infrastructure fees among freight and passenger transportations. Engineer Model split Variable Cost  (VC) and Fixed Cost (FC) int
 o freight and passenger activities, and Opportunity Cost Model takes the insufficient supply of infrastructure capacity into consideration. Of course, the subsidy from the government greatly affected the price standard for bottleneck facilities, or so-called network infrastructures.

A Methodology of Effective Measurement for Link Traffic* 

Gaogang Xie1, Jianhua Yang1, Junfeng Wang2, Zhongcheng Li1 

  Abstract?Precise and real time measurement of link traffic is the fundamental procedure of traffic engineering, network behavior Monitoring and capacity planning. The methodology of measuring links traffic by polling every device for large-scale network will impact performance of routers and bring up heavier traffic into the network. Further more, this methodology cannot meet the requirement of time scale since there are so many SNMP supported devices in network under management. How to decide the minimal set of devices to be interrogated with the premises of traffic of every link being confirmed is the key to resolve this problem. In the paper, traffic measurement mechanism is introduced and a sufficient condition is proposed for measuring each link on the network. The sufficient condition can include the condition of weak vertex cover proposed by Yuri Breitbart[12]. A policy of traffic measurement is designed based on the sufficient condition. An example is used to explai
 n the process of the policy. The methodology can decrease the number of nodes to be monitored and reduce the traffic caused by measurement. The policy has been used to network management system of Long-Distance Education Project supported by NEPC.

Abstract In large computer network, the isolation of the primary source of failure is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel approach of modeling network fault diagnosis. With the model based on reachable theorems, we design an automated fault identification algorithm and analyze its performance and validity named as DAFMA. To judge the consistency between the fault effect of the given failure sources and the testing one, an efficient algorithm is also proposed named as FFEAJ. DAFMA can be carried out automatically in computer because both DAFMA and FFEAJ are based on matrix and Boolean operations. Finally, to illustrate the details of DAFAM,  four classical fault effects are classified and the working steps of DAFAM are described.

A New Formal Test Suite Specification Language For IPv6 Conformance Testing
Zhang Yujun Li Zhongcheng

Abstract IPv6 is the next generation Internet protocol. More and more productions supporting IPv6 have been developed, which makes IPv6 conformance testing necessary.  The test suite specification language is very important for conformance testing. Because the current test suite specification languages (such as TTCN) can't meet the IPv6 testing requirements, this paper defines a new formal test suite specification language (abbreviated by TSSL). TSSL can describe any test packet and any test behavior needed for IPv6 testing. TSSL is also appropriate for IPSec testing and has the ability to simulate multiple testers on a single tester.  The test platform supporting TSSL has been developed.

A New (t,n) Threshold Image Hiding
Scheme for Sharing a Secret Color Image
Chin-Chen Chang  Iuon-Chang Lin  Chaiyi,
Abstract The objective of this research is to develop a method to hide a secret color image inside a set of meaningful color images. It allows a group of _ members to share the secret image such that any _ or more members can cooperatively construct the secret color image, but __ _ __ or less members cannot.  In addition, this technique has some outstanding properties. The embedded image can be 512 colors,  and the size can be as big as that of the cover images. On the other hand, prior schemes have a secret weakness that some members may cheat other members to obtain their shares. Our new scheme can withstand the cheating attack. Therefore, the new technique is superior to previous works. Finally, our experimental results will also reveal that the distortion between our stego-image and cover image is inconspicuous.

An Efficient Session Key GenerationProtocol
Chin-Chen Chang, Chi-Yien Chung  Chiayi,
Abstract-Key exchange is an important subject in cryptosystem, which has marched the world into the complicated application of communication technology nowadays. A common cryptographic technique is used to encrypt each individual's conversation with a separate key, which is so-called session key.  The lifespan of a session is the period of a particular communication session. Instead of depending on discrete logarithm like many previously proposed schemes, we use public key cryptography here. In this paper, we will combine key exchange with digital signature. Adopting the ring topology and then co-operating with the RSA algorithm to encrypt secret random numbers, every one gets all the random numbers after several turns, and then the session key is generated.  Because of the presence of a trusted third party, our proposed protocol can withstand the man-in-the-middle attack as well.

PATCH ON WEB OBJECTS
Tay Teng Tiow Zhang Yong D
Abstract--In this paper, we propose in the context of Internet browsing a method to generate a patch that will convert a stale web object into its most current version. The patch,  which is a sequence of edit operations, is delivered to the client, and the client uses the patch to update the stale object that is retrieved from its local cache or a nearby cache server. This incremental update scheme can reduce the average response time and increase cache-hit rate. We unify the web object types and transform each web object into a corresponding tree. In the tree space, we generate the patch on the web object using a dynamic instruction set. We also discuss patch on raw data with awareness of the underlying file application.

in Diffserv Domain
*Mohamed EL HACHIMI , *Abdelhafid ABOUAISSA, *Pascal LORENZ, **Rao SATHYA
Abstract-- The migration of classic Internet to support real time and multimedia applications  (videoconference, VoIP) require improvement of the network level service. Since several real-time and multimedia applications are multicast, our interest is to integrate diffserv and multicasting in order to satisfy QoS requirements of the multicast group. The problem on which we are concentrated in this paper is related to provide QoS requirements for multicast applications using Diffserv and principally on overload traffic, which may be created by replication of multicast packets in diffserv domain. In this case,  policing component in diffserv routers may perform dropping packets and because core routers are working by aggregation, thus other traffics (the rest of traffic) may be affected. In this paper, we present a new protocol called Control for QoS-based Multicasting in Diffserv (CQMD) to resolve the multicast and Diffserv integration problem. This paper shows what conditions
  the new member can be accepted into the multicast group in DiffServ domain.  In addition CQMD can achieve QoS-satisfaction,  ensure protection for other traffics in diffserv domain, good resources management and incur less message overhead.

On Enforcing the Fairness of Bandwidth Allocation among Internet Flows 
YIN Jian-hua, CAO Yang, LING Jun, HUANG Tian-xi 
   Abstract:Presents a new algorithm for active queue management, namely DTB. This buffer control technique is used to enforce approximate fairness among large number of concurrent Internet flows. Like RED (Random Early Detection) and other AQM (Active Queue Management) algorithms, the DTB algorithm can be deployed to actively respond to gateway congestion, keep the gateway in a healthy state, and protect the fragile flows from being stolen bandwidth by greedy ones. The algorithm is based on the so-called dual token bucket (DTB) mechanism, it's analyzed and evaluated by simulation, and proved to be effective in protecting the gateway buffer and controlling the fair allocation of bandwidth between flows.

Abstract In this paper, a novel hierarchical packet fair scheduling model is proposed based on J. Bennett and H.  Zhang scheduling model. The soft-QoS traffics introduced in this new model together with hard-QoS and best-effort traffics are scheduled by the router. The model can distribute bandwidth reasonably between the QoS and the best-effort traffics. It also guarantees the validness and fairness among the QoS traffics.

Wenjie Li, Yiping Gong, Bin Liu
Abstract  High performance switch architectures with hundreds of Gbps switching capacity are needed to the nextgeneration routers. In this paper, we propose and analyze a parallel packet switch which has a 160 Gbps full-duplex switched backplane, supporting 16 ports, each operating at OC192c (10 Gbps) line rate. This switch uses parallelprocessing policy and can support variable-length traffic.  Based on it we also present a simple and novel QoSguaranteed scheduling algorithm, named IPRR (Inlet Priority Round Robin). By comparing it with the noted iSLIP algorithm, we prove that IPRR can provide better QoS  (Quality of Service) control to network traffic.

Junfeng Wang1, Jianhua Yang2, Gaogang Xie2, Mingtian Zhou1 
  Abstract?OSPF is the most popular Interior Gateway Protocol proposed by IETF to distribute routing information among routers belonging to the same Autonomous System. OSPF for IPv6, also refered to as OSPFv3, has been widely researched and implemented by many manufacturers in various devices such as routers and operation systems. Since IPv6 has been regarded as the kernel protocol of the next generation Internet, Conformance of all OSPFv3 implementation with protocol specification is the premises to guarantee the interoperability between various routing devices. Protocol Conformance Test System (PCTS) is used for verifying whether the Implementation Under Test (IUT) conforms to protocol specification. How to generate complete testcases is one of the most important issues in PCTS. In this paper, after analysizing the mechanism of OSPFv3, we use CPNs to model the main features of this complex protocol. The construction of this CPN model is presented, and the state space analys
 is is given based on the Occurrence Graph.

Lin Chuang, Li Yin
Abstract In this paper, we propose a new packet loss control mechanism   Dynamic Partial Buffer Sharing scheme.  With DPBS scheme, the thresholds are dynamically adjusted in run-time based on packet loss behavior. So that DPBS scheme avoids parameter-setting problem, and it can achieve desired relative packet loss ratio easily. In addition, DPBS scheme can achieve higher buffer utilization for its adaptation to network fluctuation. Simulation results show that DPBS has better performance than SPBS scheme under same traffic conditions.

IP Traffic Transmission Over the General Packet Radio Services
Jahangir H. Sarker

Abstract: One IP terminal can occupy a multiple number of slots within time frames in the GPRS networks. A limited number of radio resources (slots)  are allocated in a base station for such IP terminals. If one IP terminal can occupy only one slot discontinuously in a time frame, for a real time packet transmission, the number of accepted calls is obtained by dividing the number of radio resources during that time by the maximum allowed number of IP calls. The real time IP traffic flow over the GSM-GPRS network is discussed in [1]. An analysis for the non-real time bursty IP packet transmission over the GPRS air interface that measures the channel efficiency and the probability that a packet is forced for queuing and the header/payload ratio are executed in this paper. Results show that the channel efficiency as well as the probability that a packet is forced for queuing increases with increasing call intensity, maximum number of admitted IP calls and the burstiness factor. 
 The channel utilization decreases with the increase of header/payload ratio.  Keywords: Air interface, GPRS, GSM, IP Traffic, non real-time.

This scheme is based on linear estimation of flow rate and feedback control between neighbor nodes. Simulation results show that, when the LFCS scheme is adopted, the stability of link state is improved and, as a result, the queuing delay and loss probability of the congestion node is reduced by an order of magnitude..

Zhen Chen, Zeng-Ji Liu and Zhi-Liang Qiu
Abstract---In this paper, we propose the C1-Networks,  including the Complete C1-Networks and the Incomplete C1- Networks, which are evolved from the B-Networks. The main difference between the Complete C1-Networks and the Bnetworks is their connecting pattern between the stages. The available MINs to date are almost all restricted by the port number in the power of 2. The C1-Network is not under the control by this restriction, hence a good flexibility. In addition,  the single-buffer performance model is developed and evaluated, and some results are given.

Design an Active Queue Management Algorithm Based Fuzzy Logic Decision
FAN Yanfei, REN Fengyuan, LIN Chuang
Abstract Active Queue Management achieves the objective of congestion control in some degree, and is becoming a research focus in the Internet community. Most of the existing AQM algorithms follow the probability-based packet dropping mechanism originated from RED, which goes against the router performance optimization because random number generation requires rather computational effort. In this paper, we define a congestion index to indicate the degree of the network congestion. Then, a novel intelligent packet dropping mechanism is designed based on fuzzy logic. The off-line integration greatly simplifies on-line process, which is very beneficial to optimize the router performance. The simulation results show that the intelligent mechanism is superior to the classical RED algorithm.

QOS Management Network
Dr. Dan XiaoProf. Wendong Wang

Abstract  Quality of Service (QoS) refers to the capability of a network to provide better service to selected network traffic over one kind of networks or a heterogeneous network, including IP, ATM, Frame Relay or SONET. However, the current existing QoS technology is not efficient in such a heterogeneous network environment. In this paper, QoS Management Network  (QMN) concept is proposed. Its basic idea is that QoS guarantee should be implemented based on overall network environment in order to provide regulation and management of network resources. The proposed QMN is vendor neutral, relatively static, and it is flexible to scale from a partial network domain to a larger network domain.  It does not replace the current existing QoS technology,  rather it acts as traffic control and management center with three unique capabilities to achieve QoS requirements using either SIP or ATM UNI over the heterogeneous network as described in details in this paper.

Implementation of Expedited Forwarding Using DynamicHop Counts Based Absolute Priority Scheduling
Ge Jingguo, Yang Mingchuan, Qian Hualin
Abstract  As the scalability of implementation of Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior (EF PHB) becomes a crucial problem in Diffserv Framework, the simple FIFO packets scheduling algorithms attracts more attentions recently. However, the worst
end-to-end delay of FIFO algorithm is proportional to the maximum hop counts of flows.  In our study, the Hop counts Based Relative or Absolute Priority scheduling (HBRP/HBAP)  algorithms have been proposed to balance the differences of end-to-end delay of flows that traverse paths of different hop counts, which decrease the worst end-to-end delay bound of whole domain and improve the maximum allowable network utilization level accordingly. It is too simple for the HBAP algorithm to improve the delay performance perfectly and it is too complex for the HBRP to deploy. In this paper,  we propose a new Dynamic Hop counts Based Absolute Priority scheduling algorithms  (DHBAP) with similar delay performance to the HBRP while the computational complexity DHBAP is decreased to O(1). The performances of the DHBAP are compared with those of FIFO,  HBAP and HBRP algorithms by theoretic
analyses and simulation experiments.

Minimal Bandwidth Multicast-Broadcast Routing Algorithms
Mona A. Abou-Of Wafaa A. El-Haweet, Soheir A. Bassiouny, M. Nazih El-Derini
Abstract-The purpose of this paper is to reduce the communication costs for applications that send the same data to multiple recipients across a wide-area network. Existing multicast and broadcast routing mechanisms are not efficient in terms of storage, bandwidth consumption and traffic concentration: data packets or membership information are occasionally sent over many links that don,t lead to receivers or senders, respectively.  This paper constructs two different delivery trees, the collection of nodes (routers) and links that a multicast or a broadcast packet traverses, by two heuristic algorithms. The first tree is a single spanning tree to deliver broadcast packets with minimal network cost and minimal number of traversed links. The second tree is a single minimal bandwidth groupshared tree (MBGST) per group, to deliver a multicast packet. This tree is a constriction of shortest-path multicast tree (SPT) in order to minimize the number of traversed links. The results 
 indicate a 45% reduction of the multicast load independent from the network growth. This realizes a greater traffic concentration and it balances the load over the traversed routers (nearly equal fan-out). This reduces the maximum fan-out at each node, which avoids the CLR increasing at the switching node. The multicast MBGST tree is suitable for constructing the group-shared tree required by PIM-SM protocol, which uses both SPT and group-shared tree for multicast packet delivery according to the application,s delay sensitivity.  The correctness, stability, optimality then fairness in distributing load over the traversed routers, and scaling properties of these algorithms make it well suited for large heterogeneous networks.

Load Balancing based on pseudo-Anycast and pseudo-Mobility in IPv6
Yanjun Feng, Chuck Song, Wanming Luo, Runguo Ye
Abstract We proposed a new Load Balancing mechanism, called LBAM (Load Balancing based on pseudo-Anycast and pseudo-Mobility in IPv6), by which sessions can be distributed across a pool of servers for maximum performance. Load balancing is needed in many fields, such as Web server, FTP server and NAT gateway, and there exist several approaches for load balancing. However, current approaches have problems such as poor scalability, inability to balance session flow, long latency time, and topological constraint on server pools. In this paper, we describe how LBAM works in principle without the above problems. We also present our simulation work using NS-2 and discuss performance comparison between LBAM and other load balancing mechanisms. The results show that LBAM has very advanced performance and scalability. Finally, the ubiquitous applications of LBAM in NGI (Next Generation Internet) are presented.

Probe follow congestion control mechanism*
Zhao Yongxiang Chen Changjia Zhang Yunfei
Abstract A TCP flow increases its sending rate linearly until a packet loss is detected. The lost packets can be seen as the cost paid by the method of probing available network bandwidth. A router can decide whether to drop a received data packet only based on its locally available network resource without considering the sender of the packet is responsible or not.  Therefore, such a scheme does not motivate end users to use congestion control mechanism. Accordingly, TCP flows have to endure packet loss.  In this paper, we propose a novel congestion control mechanism named as Probe Follow Congestion Control (PF-CC)  mechanism, with which users can be classified into two categories:  probers and followers. Probers are those users that are responsible for probing available network resources. Followers are those users that regulate their behavior based on the probing results by probers. Thus a follower is deserved a small probability of packet loss since it does not probe avail
 able network resource. The routers will drop a packet by considering the behavior of its source. More specifically, For example, router can reward those responsible users by rarely drop their packet and punish those non-responsible user by drop their packet severely. Therefore the PF-CC mechanism can motivate end users to conduct end-to-end congestion control. Specifications of the mechanism are presented and the performance of it is evaluated via extensive simulations and analysis.

A new framework for congestion control of integrated services
in computer networks1
Liansheng Tan, Min Yin and Li Chen
Abstract In this paper, we present a novel control-theoretic explicit rate (ER) allocation algorithm for congestion control of available bit rate (ABR) service in high-speed computer communication networks. The proposed control uses a proportional-integrative-plus-derivative (PID) controller rather than the usually adopted proportional-plus-derivative (PD)  controller. Based on a general traffic model of computer network and on system stability criterion, it is shown that under PID controller the source rates are regulated in such a manner that the congestion-controlled network is asymptotic stable in terms of both the buffer occupancy of the destination node and the user transmission rates, and the bandwidth fairness is achieved. The basic control theory approach for the algorithm is firstly presented, specifically z-transformation and Schur-Cohn stability test are used to achieve the stability. Steady state analysis is subsequently given to show how the max/min fairness is 
 achieved in a natural way without additional computation. We then use simulations to compare the performance of the PID congestion control scheme with the PD control scheme under a variety of networking conditions and loads. Our simulation results show that certain PID scheme produces advantages over PD scheme,  namely PID control scheme leads to less buffer occupancy, faster response of the buffer occupancy as well as of the controlled ABR rates, smaller steady overshoots of ABR traffic and better
utilization of network links.

Wei Yan  Edwin Hou  Nirwan Ansari
Abstract- Recent work in traffic analysis has shown that modern network produces traffic streams that are self-similar over several time scales from microseconds to minutes .Simulation studies have demonstrated that self-similarity leads to larger queueing delays and higher drop rates than the Markovian Short Range Dependence (SRD) traffic. At the same time, the dramatic expansion of applications an modern network gives rise to a fundamental challenge for network monitoring and security . Therefore, it is critical to reduce the degree of second order scaling for better network performance and detect traffic anomalies efficiently .In this paper , we propose an approach which can capture the traffic anomalies and decrease the degree of Long Range Dependence at the conjunction of  the optical packet switching backbone network . In this method, a traffic shaping technique is proposed and a reference model is generated based on the well-behaving traffic for anomaly detection .Furt
 her, we apply the compensation bursty parameter for smoothing the deviation error caused by burstiness difference existing in the traffic data sets. The simulation results show that our work can decrease the degree of self-similarity and detect the anomaly-behaving traffic efficiently.

Attack Recall Control in Anomaly Detection
Anh Tran Quang, Qianli Zhang, Xing Li
Abstract This paper presents an approach to controlling the attack recall in an anomaly detection system using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The recall and precision of SVM are controlled by the selection of the training model.  The training model is selected by optimization method using Genetic Algorithm. A SVM training model optimization problem is presented and an expected attack recall is controlled by a tradeoff parameter ? in the objective function.  Experiment results demonstrate that as ? increases from 0 to 1, the recall increases from 0 to 1. If we use the value of ? to estimate the recall, the mean square error of this estimation is decreased during the evolution of the training model. Our approach allows a user to design a system with an expected recall while the precision is high.

WSAP: Provide Loss Rate Differentiation with Active Queue Management
Miao Zhang, Jianping Wu, Chuang Lin, Ke Xu
Abstract  How to provide service differentiation on the Internet is a hot research topic. One proposal is to provide loss rate differentiation by assigning levels of drop precedence to IP packets. In this paper, we propose a new AQM mechanism, Weighted SAP (WSAP) to achieve this goal.  WSAP is based on a new AQM algorithm Simple Adaptive Proportional (SAP). WSAP can approximate proportional loss rate differentiation, while keeping high link utilization and short queuing delay. Compared with WRED and RIO,  WSAP is easier to configure and can provide better performance. Further more, an architecture for differentiated service is proposed in this paper. In the design of this architecture, we pay more attention to the characteristics of network traffic in the Internet and try to preserve the Internet's original design principles.1

Abstract - The Stream Control Transmission Protocol  (SCTP) is a new general-purpose transport layer protocol developed by the IETF. Compared with TCP,  SCTP has two distinct features: multi-homing and multi-stream. Our work investigates the SCTP performance in various network environments, and its availability for different applications. This paper proposes a SCTP multi-homing scheme as the transport layer solution for wireless multi-access networks, using GPRS for retransmission when WLAN connection is interfered, collided or congested.  We also evaluate the transport protocol behaviors for e-commerce applications. Through the experiments based on the Linux kernel implementation, we find the SCTP scheme can provide better throughput and more robustness in wireless access networks.

Abstract-Dealing  with dynamic networks, specified in natural language, and sometimes  featured  with  hierarchical routing  architecture,  routing  protocols  face  two  hard  problems  in  the  conformance  testing: generation of a large quantity of test data and automation of the test process. For the special case of an Interior Gateway Protocol OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), algorithms and procedures are proposed to test automatically the Router Under Test taking the duty of any router in a given network topology. The OSPF protocol, mainly its routing information processing, is formalized as the basis of discussing routing information generation algorithms, neighboring routers simulation and strategy for automatic test process. Applied in practice, this test method compensates for the shortage of existing test means, covering OSPF intra-area,  inter-area  and  AS  external  routing  information processing functions and increasing the test speed greatly by employing auto
 matic execution.

An Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Patterns Learning Algorithm
Yingjie Yang, Fanyuan Ma
Abstract Currently, most anomaly detection patterns learning algorithms require a set of purely normal data from which they train their model. If the data contain some intrusions buried within the training data, the algorithm may not detect these attacks because it will assume that they are normal. In reality, it is very hard to guarantee that there are no attack items in the collected training data. In this paper,  we present an unsupervised anomaly detection patterns learning algorithm, which can overcome the shortage.

Weighted Max-min Fair Scheduling in Input-Queued Crossbar Switches
PENG Laixian, TIAN Chang and ZHENG Shaoren
Abstract The input-queued switching architecture,  because of its scalability, has become attractive for implementing high-speed switches and routers. For an inputqueued switch, it is challenging to provide a scheduling scheme that is both highly efficient and fair in bandwidth allocation. Existing schedulers attempt to improve throughput by scheduling cells free of contention for transmission, at the expense of delay and fairness. In this paper, we proposed a weighted max-min fair scheduling(WMFS) scheme for input-queued switches that provides weighted max-min fair bandwidth allocation distribution among the flows. Results from simulation show that the scheme is able to achieve asymptotically 100% throughput and low cell latency under uniform traffic, and,  provide approximately weighted max-min fair bandwidth allocation and normalized fair service guarantees in the presence of misbehaving traffic.

A Novel Traffic Dispatch Algorithm for the Parallel Packet Switch
Yuguo Dong1, 2, Xiaodong Liu1, Zupeng Li1, 2 and Yunfei Guo1
Abstract The performance of the parallel packet switch (PPS) is limited by the size of buffer on each I/O port. Large port buffer will increase the delay time and make the PPS impractical. A novel traffic dispatch algorithm called SQ-UA is therefore proposed in order to downsize the port buffer of the PPS. SQ-UA chooses the shortest queue among the unused FIFO while keeping the uniformity of traffic. We use a new technique of analysis to determine the minimum bound of the port buffer and the queuing delay of the PPS in the worst case.

How smooth is Smoothed Round Robin?*
QI Wangdong1, DONG Min2, SHEN Qingguo2, CHEN Hua1
Abstract A simulation result in the original paper about SRR indicates that SRR, an O(1) time complexity round robin scheme, is almost as good as the time stamp based WFQ in delay properties. This poses an interesting question of whether the simple SRR-like schemes are able to replace the more complex WFQ-like schemes to provide QoS guarantees in high-speed networks. This is not a straightforward question, however, because the performance of round robin schemes (including SRR) are heavily dependent on network conditions. To obtain meaningful results, one has to explore the whole parameter space. We describe network conditions in two dimensions: traffic patterns and weight distributions. We conduct extensive simulations systematically in a variety of scenarios in terms of traffic patterns and weight distributions, to investigate the performance of SRR as compared with Deficit Round Robin and WF2Q+. It is shown that under most cases SRR has delay performance approximating WF2Q+
  and better than DRR.

The Performance of Scheduling Algorithms with a Prospect of
Bandwidth Overprovisioning*
QI Wangdong1, CHEN Hua1, DONG Min2, SHEN Qingguo2, CHEN Xiaoshu3
Abstract Between the two broad categories of packet scheduling algorithms, round robin and time stamp based schemes, the former are usually not considered proper candidates for providing QoS guarantees. In this paper, we challenge such conventional wisdom by comparing them from a new and more balanced perspective. Taking the scheduler and the provisioning condition of a link as a whole, it is shown by extensive simulations that RR algorithms with a little bandwidth overprovisioning can usually beat TS ones.  Considering the prospect of bandwidth overprovisioning, it is likely that the simpler round robin algorithms would turned out to be more economic for the purpose of providing practical QoS guarantees.

A Two-Stage Distributed Shared Memory Architecture and Its Scheduling Algorithms*
Yi Peng, Yuguo Dong, Jinwu Wei and Yunfei Guo
Abstract   The performance of a high-speed router is limited by the random access rate of memories and the switching rate of the inner switch architecture. This paper proposes a two-stage distributed shared memory architecture  (TSDSM) and its scheduling algorithms which can emulate the FCFS and the PIFO output-queued (OQ) scheduling algorithms. The lower bound of the memories of the TSDSM is analyzed. We also prove that our algorithms can emulate the QQ scheduling algorithms. The most advantage of the TSDSM over other switching architectures is that the access rate of memories is commercially available and the switch
can work without speedup.

LIU Hong1, BAI Dong2, DING Wei1
Abstract- MPLS-based Explicit Routing technology is particularly useful for Internet traffic engineering. In this article, we model the optimization problem of explicit routing with multiple constraints as an Integer Programming Problem with the objective of minimizing global network congestion. This optimization problem is NP-hard. And a Heuristic Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (HAGA) is presented to solve this problem. HAGA improves simple GA model in efficiency and local search ability, by introducing adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation, and combining with heuristic method to guide the local search. The simulation results demonstrate our algorithm is effective and efficient,  and has a superior optimization performance over the simple GA in aspects such as robustness and efficiency.

The Merge and Separate plus SAR method with QOS support
in the high speed network node
Xiaodong Liu, Yuguo Dong, Julong Lan, Yunfei Guo, Jiangxing Wu
Abstract-Processing toward variable-length IP packets brings burdens to high speed network node control, caching,  management, etc. A popular solution uses a method similar to ATM Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR) in the non-ATM network node. In this paper, it is pointed out that the lowbandwidth usage of this method is not suitable for high speed network node realization. To reduce the Redundant Data Rate (RDR) and improve packet switching rate, a new fixedsize processing method, Merge and Separate plus SAR  (MAS+), in high speed network node is presented. In this new method, the packets with same input and output port addresses smaller than the fixed size are merged, and the packets larger than the fixed size are segmented. And, the computer simulations of RDR improvement and latency analysis of the new solution are also given in this paper.

SHEN Hongrui  DAI wei  ZHU Yu  CHEN Shanzhi
Abstract   In this paper, we demonstrate a mechanism for handling the congestion in MPLS LSR Node. Based on the analysis on the output queues, we develop a Class-based Virtual Queue Model. By adjusting the number of Unit FIFO allocated to Virtual Queues of multiple classes, self-adaptation for traffic burst that may lead congestion is achieved, which results in the low rate of packet loss and meets the requirement of QoS. The algorithm of expanding the bandwidth to solve congestion as traffic burst occurs for one class is specified in this paper. Also based on the analysis of traffic for one class,  the rule for handling the burst of multiple traffics is given as well. In addition to this, ANGBA algorithm is applied here for self-adaptive adjusting the bandwidth.

LSP Restoration in MPLS Network Using
Case  Based Reasoning Approach
A. Dana* A. Khadem Zadeh** K. Badie ** M.E. kalantari*** N. Reyhani**
Abstract __ Today Internet has serious problems of explosive increase of traffic caused by increased number of users. These problems degrade prominently the Quality of service (QoS), and make it difficult to provide multi-media and real time service, Various technologies are proposed to solve these problems. Especially, MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) was developed that will be used at Internet backbone network. The faults occurring in high-speed network such as MPLS may cause massive data lose and degrade QoS. To deliver a reliable service, however, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide a suitable protection for the traffic carried on the label switched paths (LSPs). This paper proposes an enhanced scheme for fast rerouting to preassigned LSPs in case of LSP or link failures. In order to minimize back-up resources, it allows possibility of splitting traffic of faulty LSP onto available alternative LSPs for fault recovery. We use pre-assigned LSPs for restoration
 , when fault occurs. Total traffic throughput and resource utilization can be maximized if the traffic of faulty LSP is split over multiple pre-assigned LSPs. In this paper a new approach to providing fault tolerance in MPLS networks using case-based reasoning as a method to find out the amount of traffic forwarded on each pre-assigned LSP based on past experiences of loading process is presented. The pre-assigned LSPs and the percentage of traffic splitting are calculated offline based on desired QoS and capacity constraints.

A Novel QoS Routing Scheme for MPLS Traffic Engineering
Zhenyu Li, Zhongzhao Zhang, Lei Wang
Abstract Emergence of MPLS facilitates the implementation of traffic engineering. The aims of traffic engineering are to satisfy diversified QoS requirements and optimize network performance. QoS routing is an essential component of traffic engineering in MPLS networks. In this paper, we propose a bandwidth constrained QoS routing scheme with additional traffic engineering objectives (BCTE)  used to establish bandwidth guaranteed LSPs in MPLS networks. The traffic engineering objectives considered in our routing scheme are to reduce call blocking probability and to balance network traffic load. To this end, we apply the maxflow problem and introduce a new metric named path saturation to our routing scheme. The simulation results show that, by taking traffic engineering objectives into account, our proposed bandwidth constrained QoS routing scheme outperforms Widest-Shortest Path (WSP).

A Parallel IP Lookup Algorithm for Terabit Router1
Kai Zheng, Hongbin Lu, Bin Liu
Abstract IP address lookup is a key bottleneck for high performance routers because they need to find the longest matching prefix. With traditional memory organization, core routers can hardly improve their performance much with the restriction of memory accessing speed. By analyzing the statistical attribution of the IP prefixes, this paper presents a novel parallel IP lookup algorithm based on a new memory organization, which can achieve much higher throughput rate while keeping the memory consumption unchanged. With current 5ns SRAM, the proposed mechanism furnishes approximately 600 million routing lookups per second.

A Heuristic Algorithm for Shortest Path with Multiple Constraints
Zeyan WANG, Tingchang WANG
Abstract Consider a network G=(V, E) with distinguished vertices 1 and n, and with a length function len:E->Z+ and a weight function wei: E->Z+ on every edge.  Two number L and W are preset positive integer. The problem, which finds a path from 1 to n such that the length of the path is at most L and the weight of the path is at most W, is NP-complete. Furthermore it is an interesting problem to find a path from 1 to n with minimum length and minimum weight when the path from 1 to n with length less than L and weight less than W does exist. Two problems are considered in this paper. At first an interactive algorithm is presented for solving the second problem. After the problem is formulated by a biobjective integer programming model, in which the length and weight of the path are minimized. A reference point of the objective value considered is introduced in the algorithm and it is generated in each iteration step to adapt to decision-maker's information, which compressed th
 e solution space. In the second a heuristic algorithm is put forward for solving two problems and the complete description of the algorithm is given at last. Finally an example demonstrates two algorithms are effective.

Autonomous Traffic Management By Using An Adaptive Routing Control
Masatomo SHIRAKAWA  Yasuo FURUKAWA
Abstract----The aim of this research is to realize autonomous traffic management by using an adaptive routing control. In this paper, new router architecture is designed to the adaptive routing. In this technique, a router always supervises a traffic situation. Communication costs for every link are calculated based on the traffic situation. Dynamic load distribution is performed by scheduling of the transmitting route on the basis of the cost. The routers cooperate by the exchange of the control information added to the packet without preventing other communication in network. The adaptive routing control is performed autonomously. As the result, communication capacity is rearranged and connection situation is improved. Moreover,  communication quality is improved by scheduling of transmission of packet. To evaluate the router and routing control software, simulation and its results are presented. Compared with routing via OSPF,  this technique gives about 75 % improvement o
 f throughput in a LAN model.

Abstract  With the incessant growth of Internet and renewal of routing protocols, it becomes a demanding task to measure the running characteristics of Routing Protocol Implementations (RPI) in a real large-scale network. In the paper we analyze the hierarchical Internet topology, and propose a method to transform the GT-ITM model to BGP-OSPF oriented Internet topology. We design and implement an Internet Routing Emulation System (IRES) as a test bed to inspect the above characteristics by combining
Internet topology generation and RPI. Using IRES, we measure and analyze the OSPF RPI on a CISCO2600 router,  and give the upper bound of the network scale it supports.  The main contribution in this paper includes: 1) We develop IRES by combining the Internet topology generation and RPI.  2) We propose a novel approach to inspect the running characteristics of RPI in a realistic large-scale network, and demonstrate this approach by experiments with IRES.

Statistical Analysis of Stability of Multicast Trees in Cumulative Layered Multicast
Shi Feng, Wu Jianping, Xu Ke
Abstract In this paper, we consider the stability of a multicast (one-to-many) tree in cumulative layered multicast,  which is traditionally realized by dropping a layer when congestion is detected. First, We define a stability index to evaluate and quantify trees's stability. Then, for obtaining the general expression of the stability index, we develop a simple statistical model, which is based on the link-dependent model and the dependency-degree model in [3]. We show that even in the case of lower link-marking probability, the stability of multicast tree is significantly more sensitive to network congestion when dependency between different links becomes smaller, indicating that more links will leave the tree when congestion occurs.

A Novel Model to Analyze the Performance of Routing
Lookup Algorithms
Liang Zhiyong, Xu Ke, Wu Jianping
Abstract To forward packets fast and properly, routers need not only perform lookups in the routing table at high speed but also update the routing table in time. Due to confliction between reading and writing the routing table, updates must have some effects on lookups. To quantify the effects, we propose a performance model based on the queuing theory. The model mainly analyzes the effects of updates on lookup throughput and delay. We also apply the model to a fast lookup algorithm 24-8 multibit tries. We examine the modeling results and present a high efficient update algorithm that greatly improves the update performance of 24-8 multibit tries and lessens the effects of updates on lookup performance. Besides 24-8 multibit tries, the model can also be applied to other routing lookup algorithms.

Reexamining the Stability of a Parallel Packet Switch with Bufferless Input Demultiplexors*
QI Wangdong1, TIAN Chang2, CHEN Hua1, XU Bo2
Abstract A counter example is given to contradict an impressive result published recently about the stability of a parallel packet switch with bufferless input demultiplexors.  While it was claimed in [1] that the number of switching planes K should be at least 2?R/r??  1 to make the PPS stable,  we give a stable PPS with K = ?R/r??+ 1, where R and r is the rate of external and internal ports of the PPS respectively. To justify the validness of the counter example, we introduce a new mathematical model of the demultiplexors in the PPS,  which would be useful in the investigation of the stability of
the PPS architecture in general.

The Impacts of Burst Assembly on the Traffic Properties in Optical Burst Switching Networks*
Jiangtao Luo, Qingji Zeng, Hao Chi, Zhizhong Zhang and Huandong Zhao
Abstract  Optical Burst Switching (OBS) is regarded as one of the most promising solutions for next generation backbone. Burst assembly in the edge nodes is an important issue to be addressed in OBS networks. In this paper, the impacts of burst assembly using different schemes on the Poisson traffic properties are investigated and simulated. The results are shown that the intervals of assembled bursts' arrivals are short dominant, but their service time distributions are much different from each other due to different assembly schemes. When the timer-based scheme used, a normal-like distribution is obtained, while a long dominant one is obtained when threshold-based scheme is adopted. In addition, the product of the traffic load and line rate keeps invariable in both cases.

Abstract__ A newly high performance ATM switch, called Fast Multicast Parallel-Banyan switch, has been introduced for handling Multirate traffic and higher bit rate services required for ATM cell processing specially in case of bursty data.  The architecture is based on several key principles: nonblocking,  self-routing, output queuing for delay and throughput enhancement, levels of service priority required for maintaining QoS, high level of parallelism for achieving scalability, reliability and higher speed, and multicast function with efficient use of bandwidth.  The switch is modeled analytically and simulated. The experiment results are similar to the analytical results. The Tandem-Banyan Multicast switch is also analytically modeled.  The switch performance is evaluated in terms of cell loss probability, speed, delay, and maximum number of transmitted multicast cells in a time slot then it is compared with similar designs based on different approaches: Tandem- Banyan, C
 los network and multicast tree. The switch is found to be of similar or less cell loss probability and delay but it provides a higher bit rate services independently from the multicast load.

Hao Chi, Jiangtao Luo, Huandong Zhao, Jianxin Wang, Zhizhong Zhang and Qingji Zeng
Abstract In this paper, the conservative mode and the greedy mode scheduling algorithms for optical burst switch with shared optical buffer are presented and discussed.  Computer simulations compare their performance as well as that of the greedy mode with void filling algorithm. Results show that the conservative mode and the greedy mode have different characteristics under light and heavy load. Because of their lower computational complexity and FIFO characteristics, the greedy mode and conservative mode scheduling algorithms are more applicable in a real system than the void filling algorithm. Finally, a composite algorithm integrated by the conservative mode and the greedy mode is proposed, which is adapted to the input load with the help of a simple load monitor. The simulation result approves that it has favorable performance under different input load.

A New 2×1 Node Receiver Architecture for Packet Switched Networks
Zhizhong Zhang, Qingji Zeng, Jiangtang Luo
Abstract This paper proposes a new 2×1 node receiver architecture for all-Optical packet switched networks, whose basic principle can be extended to construct a larger buffer if more 2×2 switches and fiber delay lines (FDLs) are available.  The most striking characteristic of the architecture is that the buffer is achieved by a combined use of feed-forward and feedback FDLs. We describe and analyze the concrete twostage FDL architecture as it has the advantages of being the cheapest and simplest multi-stage solution. As for control strategy, we demonstrate that bottom control strategy (BCS),  which use FDL that is arranged in the feed-forward form when both feed-forward and feedback FDLs are available, is a more robust solution against bursty traffic. Simulation results show that the developed architecture (1) performs well in terms of performance metrics such as packet loss probability; (2) has a simpler control requirement and a better packet loss probability than M-Quadro[

Game Theoretic Pricing and Optimal Routing in Optical Networks
Ognian Kabranov, Abdulsalam Yassine, Dimitrios Makrakis
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a game theory based model for pricing, wavelength and flow assignment in multiwavelength optical networks. The scenario includes several backbone long-haul optical network transport service providers (NTSP), offering their services in terms of bandwidth to Internet service providers (ISP's). We present a microeconomic flow control technique that models the NTSP as non-cooperative competitors for the ISP bandwidth demands and the routing and wavelength allocation as a multicommodity flow optimization problem. We model the competition using Bertrand duopoly model where the competitors compete by lowering prices until they reach their marginal costs as price offered for unit bandwidth. The simulations show that though the non-cooperative market environment the networks can achieve profits and allocate the bandwidth requests.

Dynamic Sub-Path Protection Algorithm for Multi-Granularity Traffic in WDM Mesh Networks
Rongxi He1,2, Haibo Wen2, Guangxing Wang1, Lemin Li2
Abstract In Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)  optical networks, lightpaths are high-capacity all-optical channels. A single fiber failure can lead to the failure of all the lightpaths traversing the fiber and results in significant loss.  Therefore, effective survivability mechanisms are needed to minimize the data loss. This paper proposes a dynamic sub-path protection algorithm (DSPP) for multi-granularity traffic in WDM mesh networks. The idea of DSPP is to segment each primary path into several equal-length sub-paths, and to compute their corresponding backup paths under shared risk link groups (SRLG) constraints,  respectively. Based on dynamic traffic with different load, the performance of DSPP has been investigated via simulations.  The results show that DSPP can make the tradeoffs between the resource utilization and restoration time.

Lei Zhang Shiduan Cheng
Abstract The effects of limited-range wavelength conversion on the performance gain of survivable WDM networks are studied in this paper.  Two kinds of limited-range wavelength conversion technologies are considered: FWM (SOA in Four-Wave Mixing), XGM (SOA in Cross-Gain Modulation). By simulation in two networks:  NSFNET (the U.S. National Science Foundation backbone network) and CERNET (Chinese Education and Research network), the blocking performance of WDM networks with above limited-range wavelength conversions are studied.  The results show that when the WDM networks consider lightpath protection, the performance gain of wavelength conversion increases compared with that without protection. The performance gain offered by FWM wavelength converters is superior to that of XGM. The performance of XGM wavelength converter is close to that of FWM wavelength
converter with very small conversion range.  Keywords limited-range wavelength conversion;  survivability; XGM; FWM; blocking probability

An Improved Method for Guaranteed Shared Protection in WDM Optical Networks
T. Ye, Q. J. Zeng, Z. Z. Zhang, J. J. Yang and G. L. Zhu
Abstract Previous dynamic resource allocation method  (Separate Path Selection, SPS) for survivable networks is always separated into two steps, that is, determine a primary path first and then select a backup path for the primary path. In this paper we analyze the drawback of the traditional SPS technique and propose an efficient shared protection method called M_SPS. Instead of rejecting an arrival call immediately when a backup lightpath for the optimal primary lightpath cannot be found, M_SPS continue to try the sub-optimal one until a legal primarybackup pair can be selected. We apply M_SPS to CERNET_Like and NSFNET networks. Simulation results show that M_SPS improves the network performance remarkably.

Chenghua Hu,Shaoqian Liy,Youxi Tangz,Zhongling Lix
Abstract Partial parallel interference cancellation(PPIC) for wideband code division multiple access(WCDMA) uplink with complex spreading is investigated in this paper. The chan-nel model assumes independent paths with Rayleigh fading statistics. The effects of the receiving bit error rate(BER) of last stage, interference cancellation weight(ICW),the power ratio of pilot to date channels, multiple access and multi-path interference, additive white Gaussian noise(AWGN) and channel estimation error are analyzed. Then, the BER perfor-mance of multi-stage PPIC is evaluated through characteristic function method. Results indicate that all factors determining the optimal weight certainly affect the BER performance of PPIC. Optimal weight PPIC(OW-PPIC) have better BER performance than constant weight PPIC (CW-PPIC) utilizing the fixed best weight. It is shown that the power ratio of pilot to data channels has more impact on the performance of the following stage of PIC than that of 
 the previous stage of PIC. Finally, theoretical results are verified by Monte-Carlo simulation.

Closed Loop Mode 1 Transmit Diversity with High Speed Downlink Packet Access
Janne Kurjenniemi 1 , Jari Leino 1 , Yrjö Kaipainen 2 , Tapani Ristaniemi 1
Abstract - In this paper we consider the performance of a Closed Loop Mode 1 transmit diversity in WCDMA network when High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) scheme is used. Motivation for the use of multiple antennas arises from the expected gains in performance of a wireless link. In Closed Loop Mode 1 technique base station uses a suitable weight, which correspond to phase adjustment, for its second transmission antenna according to UE's feedback commands. The study of the effects of it to the system's performance in a dynamic environment is extremely crucial due to the fact that phase adjustment may lead to destructive combining of received phases due to mobility and feedback errors and, as a consequence, might even lead to performance losses rather than gains for the system. In this paper we study the effect of mobility, feedback errors and feedback delays to the system performance and draw conclusions about the achieved capacity gains/losses.

Abstract   In this paper, a path-loss-based Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), which successively decodes mobile users assigned to the same cell from the one with minimum path loss to the one with the maximum path loss and removes their contribution from the received signals in the same sequence, is proposed to reduce both the outage probability and the inter-cell interference of cellular CDMA systems.

N-Class Replacement Policy for Resolving Mobility Database Overflow
Kuen-Liang Sue and Chi-Chun Lo
Abstract Visitor Location Register (VLR) may overflow due to the limited capacity. By replacing an existing record, the overflow users can still receive services. The most-idle replacement (MR) policy was proposed to improve the performance of the random re-placement (RR) policy. The MR policy seems to be optimum and outperforms the RR policy significantly. However, the MR policy has potential limitations. Accordingly, we propose the N-class re-placement (NR) policy to overcome the drawbacks. Moreover, the simulation results show that the NR policy outperforms the MR policy in most scenarios investigated in our study. As N increases, the improvement becomes more considerable.

Mugen Peng, Jinwen Zhang, Yang Liu, Wenbo Wang
Abstract Because of Multi-user Detection (MUD) and discontinuous transmission in TDD-CDMA uplink (UL) system, the well-known formulation of UL background noise rise (BNR) for FDD-CDMA doesn't adapt to TDD-CDMA. This paper discussed a modified BNR formulation for UL system capacity and load when multi-carrier is involved in the TDD-CDMA cellular network. Additionally, frequency allocation algorithms (FAAs) are described for TDD-CDMA system, and some dynamic slow-frequency hopping (DSFH) algorithms, which are based on the rapid frequency quality measurements, are proposed to enhance spectral efficiency and improve system capacity. In our work, the performance of various FAAs and DSFH algorithms are evaluated and compared by system level simulator. The simulation results show that the UL capacity and load can be estimated by the modified BNR formulations. Furthermore, least BNR FAA is one of the most suitable FAA schemes and C/I based DSFH can provide more gains than other DSFH 
 algorithms.

A Novel Channel Allocation Scheme to Enhance Resource Utilization in CDMA / TDD
Yanbo Cao, Bin Zhou and Chengshu Li
Abstract---CDMA/TDD has the flexibility on the resources allocation. Most of CDMA/TDD system adopt same time slot allocation strategy for avoiding unexpected interference. However, the level of traffic asymmetry may be different from cell to cell. If these differences are great and cells are fuly loaded, CDMA/TDD system adopting same time slolt allocation strategy lose the system capacity. A novel cross time slot strategy based on smart antenna is presented to overcome this problem. The simulation results show that if the levels of the traffic asymmetry between neighboring cells are great and fully loaded, the system adopting cross time slot allocation can improve system resource utilization.
Keywords---CDMA/TDD; cross time slot allocation; difference of traffic asymmetry; smart antenna


Proactive Earliest Due-Date Scheduling in Wireless Packet Networks
Keng-Hoe Teh, Peng-Yong Kong, and Shengming Jiang
Abstract---Providing deadline-based scheduling in wireless networks is a challenging problem because the medium suffers from location-dependent errors. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling policy called Proactive Earliest Due-Date (PEDD) that proactively modifies the packets' deadlines depending on the upcoming changes in the channel states. This policy gives a higher priority to packets that will see bad channel states so that they can be scheduled before their channels turn bad. Simulation results using OPNET show that our scheme can achieve lower average packet drop ratio and higher average system throughput compared to Feasible Earliest Due-Date (FEDD). Although its average system delay is higher, it still provides delay bound guarantee which is vital for scheduling real-time traffic. The performance improvements of PEDD over FEDD will depend on how well the channel knowledge is obtained.

Fanrui Lijing Lehuihua Chengshiduan
Abstract- As mobile node takes a relatively long time to hand over and some packets are lost during these period, TCP performs badly in mobile environment. IETF present seamless handover mechanism, include fast handover and smooth handover, to reduce the delay and packet losses during handover to improve TCP performance. It is taken for granted that the performance of TCP with seamless handover is surely better than that without. However, we find that the performance of TCP especially Reno with seamless handover is worse than that without in some cases through a large number of detailed simulation. We analyze the reason inside the phenomenon and give a solution to solve it.

Jaber A. Khoja   Mazin A. Al-Shalash   Jonathan W. Bredow
Abstract  In 3G wireless systems the volume of data traffic is expected to be larger on the forward link than the reverse link. This is one of the main reasons that contribute to the forward link being the limiting link for the capacity of 3G CDMA systems. Many different algorithms interact in complex ways to affect the achieved capacity and define the system's operation and coverage. This work studies the impact of system algorithms and their parameters, like maximum base station power, power partitioning between overhead and traffic, and connection blocking algorithms. It examines their effect on forward link performance (e.g. capacity, coverage, call blocking and dropout probabilities). A dynamic system simulator is used to examine how these algorithms, and their parameters affect the system capacity/coverage tradeoff.

Parallel Low Memory Size Turbo Decoder
Kai Niu , Wei Ling Wu
Abstract The original turbo decoding algorithm is a serial mode, which requires large memory and long decoding latency. These drawbacks limit the turbo codes to the real time applications. In this paper, a parallel decoding with sliding window (PDSW) algorithm is proposed in order to reduce the memory requirement. On the one hand, the PDSW algorithm outperforms the serial algorithm by few tenths of a decibel with the same decoding complexity. In addition it requires memory approximate one magnitude less than the serial algorithm. Hence this algorithm is valuable for the hardware implementation.

Abstract In this paper, we propose and analyze a preemption based admission control policy for an integrated voice and Voice Message Service (VMS) CDMA system. Granted with the priority, the performance of voice calls is not affected by VMS. A multicode scheme is used for VMS traffic to transmit on multiple spreading codes in parallel. The SIR constraints of voice and VMS calls are taken into account to identify the system capacity. By using a two-dimensional Markov model, the performance of the integrated system is evaluated. Under different system traffic loads, QoS-based system capacities are obtained and optimal coding schemes for VMS are specified. Finally, the effect of the VMS buffer size is discussed.

Abstract-Based on a function of user, the joint packet scheduling and base station assignment for downlink in a wireless CDMA data network is considered in this paper, where base station assignment and packet scheduling are integrated to pursue the maximal system throughput. In detail, based on a given packet scheduling, mobile users' base station assignment is adjusted to attempt to maximize the system throughput. It is discovered from the analysis that the joint packet scheduling and base station assignment can be implemented in a distributed way rather than in a centralized way. Thus a distributed joint packet scheduling and base station assignment is offered. By simulation, it is shown that the system throughput has a great increase in the distributed way.

Abstract- How to control hand-off dropping rate is a very important Quality-of-
Service (QoS) issue in cellular networks. The current trend in cellular networks of reducing cell size makes this issue more difficult to resolve. A novel CAC scheme based on Adaptive Threshold control (AT-CAC) is proposed in this paper. AT-CAC can adjust admitting threshold according to hand-off dropping rate and process session requests in different methods, e.g. accepting, rejecting and queuing. It can control hand-off dropping rate effectively and increase system utilization rate at the same time. Numerical results show that AT-CAC meets our design goal and outperforms the static reservation scheme under fluctuation of system load.

Xiangguang Che 1 , Seppo Hämäläinen 1 , Jari Ryynänen 2 , Martti Moisio 3
Abstract   This paper discusses GPRS network performance optimization with a dynamic simulator. Simulator models the GSM/GPRS system and a realistic cellular environment with accurate models of e.g. propagation environment, user mobility and traffic distribution. All the relevant details of GPRS protocol stack (LLC, RLC/MAC and physical layer) are taken into account, but less focus is put on GPRS core network, signaling and IP transport layer effects. After defining a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) as the basis for the analysis, a real network configuration scenario was applied with the simulator. This setup was then used when GPRS network performance was investigated in order to find the maximum capacity for both GPRS and voice services. At the same time the effect of different Radio Resource Management (RRM) algorithms and parameter alternatives were studied, together with the dynamic interaction between Circuit and Packet Switched services. As a result of this stu
 dy, a set of optimized and tuned parameters are suggested, which could help operators to go towards more aggressive network deployments with more advanced RRM schemes and at the same time provide higher Quality of Service (QoS) to the end users with maximized capacity.

In other words, the problem to maintain the continuity of multimedia playing during the handoff is hard to solve. In order to avoid too early or over reservation resulting in a waste of resource, in this study, we present a method called TTRR (Three Times Resource Reservation Scheme), to let reserved resource become really active upon MH entering into Tire-2 [5] area of a cell. NSP and TTRR can efficiently improve the accuracy of MH's trajectory prediction, increase the success probability of resource reservation, and enhance bandwidth utilization.

Study on Delay of Proportional Fair Algorithm with Controlled Channel Quality Feedback
Xin Zhang
Abstract  The delay of a modified Proportional Fair Algorithm (PFA) is computed. The modified PFA uses a dynamic threshold to filter the feedbacks of channel quality (CQ) based on which the users' priorities are calculated ford scheduling. Only those in good CQs (relative to their own average CQ) can be the candidates for scheduling. The results show that the modified PFA with a low CQ threshold can not only reduce some feedback overhead but also maintain delay performance of the traditional PFA. Two methods of calculating priority, one based on signal to noise ratio, and the other on information rate, are considered. Their performances of delay have slight difference when fast fading components are distributed differently among users.

Abstract---Node distribution in ad hoc mobile radio networks is akey metric that can influence network performance such as connectivity and system capacity. It is known that the node distribution has a strong relationship with mobility models. However, not enough theoretical research has been done on them due to its randomness and complexity. Most researchers pick up mobility models without carefully examining their properties. This paper attempts a statistical approach on theoretical analysis of mobility models. Several important theorems with regards to mobility models and their influence on mobile node distribution are established. Furthermore, our theorem is applied on investigation of three typical random mobility models. The analysis is further validated by our simulation results. We also proposed some practical approaches on reasonable usage of mobility models.

Computer simulations confirm that the proposed diversity scheme achieves a better performance than the conventional method.

Abstract Dynamic modelling is steadily expanding and consolidating as one of the fundamental approaches in many industries including telecommunication, software development, aircraft and aerospace etc. It is particularly expressive and versatile also in modelling the specification of a complex mobile scenario. However, while the modelling of the static part of a mobile scenario results well suited and expressive, in the modelling of mobile scenarios there is a growing consensus on the fact that in the real world mobile scenarios are dynamic in nature and they are better
represented with dynamic modelling. In this paper it first comes up with introduction of a reference model which forms the basis in Wireless Strategic Initiative (WSI) research project. The CyPhone system is then presented and it is followed by a multiple phase dynamic ladder model and a dynamic loop model, which are drawn from CyPhone outdoor navigation scenario. The dynamic models explicitly portray
several environmental objects, subsystems and events to describe a complete mobile service scenario. This paper ends up with a complete picture of dynamic modelling procedure.

In this paper, we first give theoretical analyses of these problems based on the simple geometrical position relation of BS, MS and scatters, then in detail discuss these characteristics of a specific spatial vector channel model in which the scatters are uniformly distributed in a ring scatter area. The similarity of the simulation and theoretical results proves the correctness of the theoretical analyses of spatial vector channel.

Effects of Frequency-offset on the Performance of OFDM Systems
Zhang Jie, Zhou Yun, Su Ling, Zhang Ping
Abstract - Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is orders of magnitude more sensitive to frequency offset than single-carrier systems. Frequency
offset reduces the signal power and destroys orthogonality among subcarriers leading to the intercarrier interference (ICI). It is necessary to analyze how the frequency offset affects the performance of OFDM systems. This paper analyzes the relation between frequency offset, Bit-Error Rate (BER) and the channel capacity of each subcarrier based on the approximate degradation in Signal-to-ICI-Noise (SINR) caused by frequency offset. At last, some simulation figures are also given out.
Key words - OFDM frequency offset ICI BER capacity

Interchannel Interference Cancellation in Wireless OFDM Systems via Gauss-Seidel Method
QIAN Xuerong, ZHANG Lijun
Abstract  In a mobile fading environment, the time variation of the wireless channels is a dominating factor that leads to the system performance loss. Multipath delay spread also lead to a loss of subchannel orthogonality in orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) system, known as interchannel interference (ICI). In this paper, the influences of ICI in mobile OFDM system are analyzed firstly. It is shown that ICI is only a function of the symbol energy (Es), the subchannel number (N) and the Doppler frequency (fD) in OFDM system, and is independent of signal constellation. To eliminate ICI then, an equalization algorithm based on Gauss-Seidel
method is proposed. The main advantage of the iterative algorithm is to update the data vector () k x in each iterative step as soon as the part of the new data vector (1) 
k +x have been calculated, therefore, the convergence of the algorithm can be accelerated effectively. The symbol error rate for a 16-QAM system is present by means of simulation results to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Handovers between Heterogeneous Networks in Pervasive systems
Sasitharan Balasubramaniam,  Jadwiga Indulska
Abstract---Pervasive systems need to adapt computing applications or their computing enviroment if the applications are facing Quality of Service (QoS) changes (caused by a variety of reasons including mobility of users or users changing their devices). One possible adaptation is vertical handover which can redirect applications' communication streams between network interfaces on one device or between network interfaces on different devices while continuing the applications. In this paper we describe a solution for vertical handovers which is suitable for future pervasive systems. The solution utilizes context information regarding user devices, user location, network environment, and user perceived application QoS which are evaluated to make decisions about vertical handovers.

Performance of Transparent Transponder Satcom System with Interference
GUO Dao-xing, SHEN Zhong-liang, LI Ji-ping, ZHANG Bang-ning
Abstract--The robustness of transparent transponder satcom to uplink interference is investigated. Firstly the performance of transparent transponder satcom system is analyzed to uplink interference (or jamming) and the closed expression for calculating BER performance is given. Also the simulation is done for the two typical cases. It is shown that narrow-band multiple accesses combined with backoff of HPA provide robustness to jamming. The jamming level needed to cause all users unacceptable error bit rates must be comparable to the sum of the users' power. And it was found that this level is generally slightly lower than that to cause transponder saturation.

Dynamic resource management in the fourth generation wireless systems
Wang Anchun, Xiao Liang, Zhou Shidong Xu Xibin, Yao Yan
Abstract: In this text, we consider the problem of fair scheduling in the downlink of Orthogonal Frequency Division (OFDM) systems. Based on the proportional fair scheduling algorithm proposed in the CDMA/HDR, we present three schemes to manage the parallel subcarriers in the OFDM system to utilize the time selectivity and frequency selectivity. Subcarriers in a slot are divided into several nonoverlapped subbands, which are the scheduling objects. The first scheme is that every subband is placed a scheduler and the average rates are updated independently; the second scheme is that transfer the two-dimensional channel resource into one-dimension equivalent channel, and then schedule the resource like in HDR systems; the third one is that users contend every subband in a same slot using one scheduler without updating the average rates, after finished a slot, the average rates are updated together. Compared to the first scheme, the third one has the least complexity and its per
 formance degrades little. It is shown that system throughput is improved by 40%~100%, the appropriate number of subbands is 16~32 and scheme 3 is an appropriate choice for practice systems.

Abstract  One of the fundamental limitations in the conventional Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) mobile systems is fading of received signals by the elements of the base station antenna
arrays. In this paper, a modified CMA with a generalized GWSSUN channel model is introduced. In order to treat the problem of fading, a new cost function is used that yields a time-varying step size. Also, we analyze the AM/AM effect of a LNA on CDMA signals to study the BER performance in the modified CMA. Simulation results of BER performance with DBPSK modulation for linear array shows more advantage in using the proposed CMA rather than the traditional one.

Yongquan Qiang, Daoben Li
Abstract Space-time transmit diversity, as an effective scheme to mitigate multipath fading, has been proposed for IMT-2000 systems. Space-Time Transmit Diversity(STTD) has been adopted as an open loop diversity scheme for WCDMA. Orthogonal Transmit Diversity(OTD) and Space-Time Spreading(STS) are two optional schemes for CDMA2000. This paper focuses on their differences in principle and performance. Theoretical analysis presents that the schemes of OTD, STS and STTD are similar in terms of spreading structure. Simulation results show that STS scheme have 3dB advantage over STTD. STS and STTD have better performance than OTD and NTD (None Transmit Diversity) scheme.

Improved Design Criterion for Good Space-Time Trellis-Codes Under Block Fading Channels
HongYu Liang, WeiLing Wu
Abstract The design criteria for space-time codes under block fading channels are the rank criterion and the determinant criterion, which are widely cited in the literature. These criteria are not very tight under some circumstances. In this letter, we
derive a tighter design criterion for space-time codes. Based on our criterion, we have found good space-time codes by computer search. The complexity of systematic search for good space-time codes is a big obstacle to get good codes. Using our new design criterion, the complexity of search is dropped down dramatically. Simulations show that our new codes have superior performance over the existing codes.

A Novel OFDM Time and Frequency Synchronization Algorithm
Ma Zhangyong Zhao Chunming You Xiaohu
Abstract--- OFDM system performance is more sensitive to frequency offset and timing error than single-carrier systems. In this paper, the integer frequency offset is estimated based on the special pilot symbols; the timing error estimation value is obtained by the correlation characteristic of the pseudo noise sequence (PN-sequence); then the fractional frequency offset can be estimated grounded on the correlation of pilots. In order to improve the accuracy of the estimator, oversampling technology is adopted. The simulation shows that the good performance is gained , the results approach the Modified Rao Cramer .lower Bound (MCRLB).

A Low Complexity Closed-loop BLAST Architecture
Hairuo Zhuang, Lin Dai, Shidong Zhou, Yan Yao
Abstract- Original form of BLAST can provide very high data rate but is susceptible to fading correlations between transmit antennas. In this paper, we proposed an improved form of BLAST architecture that employs a low rate feedback channel to adjust the transmission mode at the transmitter adaptively. An optimal criterion to select transmit antennas and modulation modes is derived based on zero-forcing technique. Simulation results in different scenarios show that the proposed closed-loop BLAST (or C-BLAST) outperforms the open-loop V-BLAST significantly, especially when the channel is ill-conditioned, since it judiciously selects a set of antennas to avoid disastrous fading correlations. Even in rich scattering environments, it still achieves some performance gain due to more efficient power allocations.

Guoping FAN, Pingyi FAN and Zhigang CAO
Abstract A differential detection scheme for transmit diversity was proposed by Tarokh in [1], which can achieve full diversity order without the requirement to estimate the channel state at the receiver. This paper investigates the potential of using multiple receive antennas for differential space time coded MPSK signals over correlated Nakagami fadi ng channels. We also investigate the effect of the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel correlation on its performance and present some results on its maximal tolerable frequency offsets for different MPSK signals. The results have shown that the differential encoding transmit diversity is very robust to the CFO and channel correlation.

Early Resynchronization, Error Detection and Error Concealment for Reliable Video Decoding*
Shaoshuai Gao, Guofang Tu
Abstract In this paper we proposed a robust video decoding scheme using early resynchronization, error detection (ED) and error concealment (EC). Many video
coding standards such as H.263+ and MPEG-2 make the compressed video signals more vulnerable to channel errors because of error propagation due to using variable length coding (VLC). Channel errors can not only result in false decoding of current bits but also make the decoder lose synchronization. The data between the errors and next resynchronization marker (RM) will be discarded even if theyare not corrupted by channel errors. Early resynchronization can retrieve unaffected data between the errors and next RM, which can greatly reduce error propagation due to using VLC.
We combined early resynchronization with deliberately designed ED and EC technologies and tested three early resynchronization schemes in our simulation. It has been found that the third scheme can give the best tradeoff between the final reconstructed image quality and searching times.

To minimize total transmit power with constraints on BER and each user's rate requirement, in the two steps joint allocation method, we proposed an improved Rate Craving Greedy multisuer dynamic subcarrier allocation algorithm. Analysis and

achieved. Moreover, any in-between performance-complexity can be achieved by appropriately choosing parameters.

Abstract--OFDM and adaptive transmission are two most promising technique for next generation high data rate mobile communication systems. In this paper, we combine the two techniques and propose a simple and computational efficient adaptive bit and power allocation algorithm for broadband OFDM system. In the algorithm, first the bit and corresponding power are allocated to each sub-carrier according to SNR channel condition in the receiver, then the residual power is allocated to the sub-carriers which can use them most efficiently. In this way, this algorithm is efficiency while calculation is less complex. Simulation results show the
advantages of the proposed algorithm over those of equal bit loading algorithm and original SNR based adaptive allocation method.

An Analysis of the Eigenbeamformer technique in a simulated WCDMA Network
Jari Leino 1 , Markku Kuusela 2 and Tapani Ristaniemi 1
Abstract   In this paper, we present an analysis of the Eigenbeamformer (EB) technique in WCDMA cells using the single antenna transmission technique and the two-antenna Space Time Transmit Diversity (STTD) technique [6] as the references and utilizing the Dedicated Physical Channel (DPCH) for speech service as the traffic model. The EB [4] is a closed loop beamforming technique, with terminal assisted feedback, designed for multiple Tx-antennas, where the data is transmitted via orthogonal Eigenbeams. The beams are pre-calculated at each terminal by long-term integration of the correlation matrix that is diagonalized, and the Eigenvectors of this correlation matrix are sent to the base station, which then creates the beams for each terminal respectively. STTD is an open loop diversity scheme given by the orthogonal Alamouti matrix. EB is a candidate for four transmit (Tx) antenna diversity extension, and STTD is a well-known diversity technique in the 3GPP release'99 specifi
 cations. We will show some system performance results using a dynamic network simulator: the effect of some important non-idealities are included in the assumptions and they are expected to cause some degradation in performance e.g. because of the increased interference.


The Semi-blind Multiuser Receiver Based On Antenna Array
Xingqing Cheng * , Qiang Wu ** Daoben Li
Abstract--Two semi-blind multi-user receiver's algorithms based on antenna array are proposed. Here we suppose multiple receiver antennas are our targets. Firstly we estimate the known users' data and subtract them from the received signal. Secondly we obtain an orthogonal projection matrix (M) of the unknown users' signal through subspace tracking. Finally by using the matrix M, we transform the detection problem of known users' data into a minimization problem of quadratic convex function and so that we can solve it with conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm. The initial estimation of known users' data also serves as the initial value of CG to speed up convergence. We have simulated the performance of the receivers' algorithm under various conditions and concluded that they are better than other corresponding algorithms.

Frequency Offset Correction for PCC-OFDM with Overlapping Symbol Periods
Yang Cao, Yong Ren and Xiuming Shan
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the performance of a PCC-OFDM system under the environment of frequency offset. And a method using shift auto-correlation to correct the frequency offset is presented. Because of the small out-of-band power of PCC-OFDM, only four or six super sub- carriers (SSC) are used for transmit synchronous information. The essential ideal of this method is based on the independence of the symbol being transmitted. But when frequency offset exist the
demodulated symbol is correlated with each other. And the correlate degree depends on the relative frequency offset. Simulation results show that it is an effective way to estimate frequency offset.

Abstract This paper shows that the capacity of TD-SCDMA system can be enlarged further, by adopting time-switching array antennas. The TD-SCDMA systems needn't have spatial coding, since the spatial coding causes frequent spatial handoff problem.
Analyzing the array pattern, we show that the interference of other sectors, also to be MAI, can be effectively suppressed by the array antennas for a sectored TD-SCDMA system. The capacity calculating based on WLS multiuser detector in the TD-SCDMA systems is presented. Simulations show that a TD-SCDMA system with a triply-sectored uplink channel can give a SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) and a BER (Bit Error Rate) better than those in non-sectored systems with 10 times as many users.

We combined rate 1/2 Turbo code as outer code and a simple two-antenna space-time block code as inner code for transmitting diversity and one receiver antenna. The iterative decoding scheme is based on MAP algorithm. The decoding complexity is mainly determined by the trellis complexity of the outer code. Simulation results show that exploiting transmit-diversity by using space-time block codes provides remarkable performance at the expense of almost no extra processing.

Abstract  A full QoS evaluation for a newly-built network should be performed so that engineers and operators can discover and solve the problems before the network goes into operation. Because data services are becoming dominate, more care about QoS evaluation for them should be taken. This paper presents application of drive test for QoS measurements. The measurement schemes of each QoS parameter like throughput, delay, delay variation, and data loss etc. are detailedly described. These schemes proposed in this paper are effective and can be put into practice, perspectively.

An Adaptive RTS Threshold Adjust Algorithm based on Minimum Energy Consumption in IEEE 802.11 DCF
Shaohu Yan, Yongning Zhuo, Shiqi Wu
Abstract The IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) protocol provides shared access to a wireless channel. Its primary MAC technique is called distributed coordination function (DCF) that includes two packet transmission schemes, namely, the basic access and the RTS/CTS access mechanisms. In a "hybrid" network combining the two schemes, packets longer than a given threshold (RTS Threshold) are transmitted according to the RTS/CTS mechanism. The effect on average energy consumption per packet of RTS threshold is analyzed in the assumption of idea channel and network saturated condition. Further analysis shows there is an optimum RTS threshold that can get minimum average energy consumption in a given network.
Based on these analyses, we proposed an adaptive RTS threshold adjust algorithms that is effective and easily employed, with which a station can adjust its RTS threshold to adapt for variant circumstances automatically.

Random Route Discovery Packet Drop Using Load Factor of MAC Layer in IEEE 802.11 Ad Hoc Networks
Yong Peng Shiduan Cheng
Abstract: Recent research has shown that the original DCF access mode of IEEE 802.11 has low performance in heavy traffic and multi-hop environment [4] [5] . In this paper, our research focus is placed on the improvement of 802.11 networks in multi-hop environment with heavy contention area. We implement system performance enhancement through the interaction of MAC layer and ad hoc routing mechanism. We have first introduced a MAC parameter to evaluate current wireless media contention state (i.e. load factor). In order to be adaptive to the MAC layer contention, we propose a new DCF based MAC mechanism with the name of Random Route Discovery Packet Drop (R 2 DPD). This new mechanism drops ad hoc routing packets in the MAC layer according to the on-line measuring of local contention state (i.e. load factor). Stations in heavy contention environment drop route discovery packets with high probability so that the congestion is relieved. Simulation results have shown that our new
  MAC algorithm can achieve better performance than the original DCF algorithm.

Design of a Fine Tuned Self-Adapt DCF-Based Protocol 1
Yong Peng Shiduan Cheng
Abstract: Numerous researches have shown that the original DCF access mode of IEEE 802.11 has low performance in case of heavy traffic and multi-hop environment [15][16] . Based on the analysis of previous IEEE 802.11 DCF, [15] have introduced a parameter that closely relative to the traffic load of the current wireless LAN and formed a new DCF-based protocol with the name NSAD, which is proved effective in the simple one-hop environment. In this paper, we proposed a new exchange protocol to fine tune NSAD. Our goal is to solve the problems that NSAD encountered in the
error-prone multi-hop environment. We have done simulation in a more real environment than we do in NSAD [15] and the results have shown that the proposed
algorithm can achieve better performance when compared to the original NSAD algorithm (e.g. better property in goodput and fairness, window tuning accuracy).

A New Mechanism of Transmitting MPEG-4 Video in IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN with DCF
Shihong Zou, Haitao Wu, Shiduan Cheng
Abstract The basis of IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) is Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). When network load in WLAN is moderate or even higher, with DCF a station may need to defer several seconds before transmission. This will degrade the performance of real time applications such as MPEG-4 video stream. This paper proposes a new mechanism for deliver MPEG-4 video stream with DCF. Simulations show that our mechanism provides much less delay and jitter while obtains the same goodput and fairness.

A NOVEL IF CHANNEL SELECTION TECHNIQUE BY ANALOG-DOUBLE QUADRATURE SAMPLING FOR COMPLEX LOW-IF RECEIVERS
Pui-In Mak, Seng-Pan U, and R.P. Martins 1
Abstract This paper presents a novel IF channel selection technique for complex low-IF receivers. By utilizing the frequency-shifting characteristic of analog-double quadrature sampling (A-DQS), and setting the IF equal to half of the channel bandwidth, the desired channel and its image are neighbors and they can be selected to the baseband through simple control. Thus, the channel selection original performed by the front-end integer-N PLL frequency synthesizer can be partitioned to the A-DQS in the IF. The benefits of this partitioning channel selection method are 1)
the step-size of the integer-N PLL frequency synthesizer can be doubled to two channels bandwidth in order to maintain low phase noise and fast settling time in very low-IF operation, 2) the locking position of the local oscillator in the entire frequency band is halved, since the frequency synthesizer only performs the frequency down-conversion of every two channels to the IF. Such technique is especially efficient in wireless receivers for 2.4GHz 802.11b WLANs or Bluetooth that employ frequency-hopping to capture the signals.

A Multipath Routing Scheme Combating with Frequent Topology Changes in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
Zhongbang Yao, Zhengxin Ma, Zhigang Cao
Abstract  The main challenge in mobile ad hoc networks is how to discover and maintain the routes to the destinations in the wireless environment with frequent dynamic topology changes, which results from the random movements of stations. According to the number of available paths to the destination, the prior proposed routings can be classified into unipath and multipath protocols. In this paper, to combat the frequent topology changes, we propose a neighbor-table-based multipath routing scheme which utilizes the advantages of multipath routings. In NTBMR, we introduce time-driven and data- driven mechanisms to set up the neighbor table. During route discovery, a joint route selection criterion which utilizes multiple attributes of the route is employed. Simulation results show that our multipath scheme can improve the network performance in terms of packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay, which is important for real-time applications. However, the advantages are achieve
 d at the cost of overhead about 7% higher than that of the unipath routing.

Analyzing voice transmission capacity on ad hoc networks
Pedro Braconnot Velloso, Marcelo G. Rubinstein, and Otto Carlos M. B. Duarte
Abstract  This paper analyzes voice transmission capacity on ad hoc networks by performing simulations related to delay and jitter. We evaluate the influence of QoS provision and mobility on the number of voice trans-mitting sources. Results show that the maximum number of voice trans-missions can be increased when medium access time is reduced by means of a service differentiation mechanism applied to the MAC layer. Also, mo-bility and network load variations degrade the network capacity for voice transmission, mainly on multihop mobile networks.

Improved Caching Strategies in On-Demand Routing Protocols for MobileAd hoc networks
WU Dong-ya HOU Zi-feng
Abstract An On-demand Routing Protocol for mobile ad hoc networks is one that searches for and attempts to discover a route to some destination nodes only when a sending node orginates a data packet addressed to those nodes.In order to avoid the need for such a route discovery to be performed before each data packet is sent, such a routing protocol must cache routes previously discovered. Using simulations, we found that the performance of the networks which utilized DSR protocol became to be worse with the reduction of the packet sending rate. This paper aims at that phenomenon, indicates it is because that DSR routing algorithm can not check and purge the unvalid routes in time, and puts forward improved strategies of caching, searching and discarding routes in the route cache by using signal strength and time stamp thresholds. By using ns2 simulator, we studied the networks performance using improved routing algorithm and DSR, validated that the improved algorithm performe
 d better than DSR obviously.

Route Recovery Based on Anycast Policy in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
Jianxin Wang 1;2 Xicheng LU 2
Abstract Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) is a special wire-less network, which is a multi-hop temporary autonomous system of mobile nodes with wireless transmitters and receivers without the aid of pre-established network infrastructure. Because of its dy-namic topology and mobility, the path for transmitting the date is
easy failure in MANET. For the real-time transmission, route must be rebuilt rapidly after route failing. In the paper, we mainly discuss the route recovery problem and propose an efficient route recovery method based on anycast policy. By using the method, the route could be found rapidly after the transmitting route fails. But possibly the recovery route is not the best path for transmitting data. The simulation results show that the protocol gets lower average routerecovery delay than others.

The Channel Adaptive Routing for Hybrid Networks
Tian Hui, Xie Fang, Hu JianDong, Zhang Ping
Abstract Ad hoc network is expected to play a major role in future wideband wireless access to the Internet. The dual mode system that multi-hop network overlaid with a cellular structure is more and more attractive for researchers. However, routing
is important for such networks due to the dynamic nature of network topology and the resource constraints. To maximize the resource utilization and minimize the network transfer delay along the path, the shortest path with minimum hops approach is often adopted. However, the quality of wireless channel among the mobile nodes is time varying due to fading, shadowing and path loss. Considering adaptive channel coding and modulation scheme, the channel state can be characterized by different link throughput. In this paper, a channel adaptive routing (CHAR) is presented. The CHAR transforms link throughput into the channel quality factor and finds the shortest routing according to the channel quality factor measure. Simulation results show that the proposed routing may reduce the average transfer delay and increase the packet deliver rate. (Abstract)

A Novel Routing Algorithm for SEED of Hybrid Ad hoc Networks
Yu Chen, Zhaohui Lin, Wenbo Wang
Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel integrated routing algorithm to optimize hybrid ad hoc networks. There are some nodes called SEEDs in the hybrid ad hoc networks model we presented. The SEEDs work only as relay nodes with strong capabilities of radio and routes resource management. Such management is carried out by the coordination of the routes, traffic and power of a SEED itself. This novel algorithm is proposed to select the optimized route by a routing evaluating function and a joint back-off mechanism. The simulation results show that the throughput of the hybrid ad hoc networks with the novel routing algorithm is much higher than that of the conventional ad hoc.

Abstract  In this paper, the performance analysis for Ad Hoc DS-CDMA network is proposed and studied in presence of routing strategy MFR(most forward within R). The system is modeled as a two-dimensional Poisson point process with parameter ŠË considering the MFR routing scheme and DS/BPSK (direct sequence scheme with binary phase shift keying) modulation. We propose a novel pattern to resolve the dependency relationship of routing scheme and packet success probability based on DS/BPSK, and use the Expected Progress per Hop toward the direction of destination terminal to evaluate the performance of network. Finally, we give the applicable average number of terminals in Ad Hoc DS-CDMA network.

Effective Admission Control in Multihop Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
Yixin Dong, Dimitrios Makrakis, Terrance Sullivan 
Abstract  Currently, Quality of Service (QoS) support for multihop Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) is drawing more attention. Successful QoS strategies should consider the distinctive features of MANETs. In this paper, we propose and analyze an admission control mechanism, suitable for MANETs. We first propose two algorithms capable of estimating the available (to the mobile nodes) bandwidth. We then incorporate them in an admission control scheme, which allows dynamic allocation of the traffic. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed admission control mechanism is simple, yet effective in terms of maintaining the end-to-end delay below certain threshold.

A Mobile Broadband System based on Fixed Wireless Routers
Bernhard H. Walke, Ralf Pabst, Daniel Schultz
Abstract A new radio access network architecture for a mobile broadband system is introduced that uses Fixed Wireless Routers (FWR) to provide radio coverage to otherwise shadowed areas. Highest spectrum capacity and lowest possible transmit power as main targets will be reached by using low power (1 W) pico base stations using a wireless or mobile broadband air interface at Access Points (AP) to the core network and at FWRs to trade the high capacity available at APs against radio coverage range. The so-called Wireless Media System (WMS) will provide broadband access to terminals with medium velocity of movement and is embedded into a cellular radio network to support a high velocity of terminals with medium
transmission rate. The low power used at the base stations leads to a pico-cellular concept relying essentially on multi-hop communication across fixed wireless bridges or routers and to some extent also on ad-hoc networking. The new concept to achieve broadband radio coverage in densely populated areas is described and first analysis results of some crucial elements are presented.

Abstract: For the third generation systems' low frequency efficiency and small system capacity, there should be greatly changed in physical techniques in fourth generation mobile communication systems while many advanced techniques suited for high bite rate, high frequency efficiency and large dynamic range, such as JT, STC, MIMO, OFDMA, distributed antenna, are taken into considerations. But besides physical techniques, basic network layer techniques, e.g., the constructions of cellular and the modes of handover, must be broken through in the fourth generation mobile communication systems. The group cell structure proposed in WTI is a novel cellular construction method, which is fit well for these new advanced physical techniques. And slide handover is also novel handover mode emphasized in this paper. According to the current research, the slide handover could improve the system capacity dynamically.

Radio Resource Sharing Model for Coexisting IEEE 802.11e Wireless LANs
Stefan Mangold, Lars Berlemann, Bernhard Walke
Abstract A game model is developed and evaluated to analyze the Quality of Service (QoS) support in IEEE 802.11e Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) that share radio resources in a coexistence scenario. In such scenarios, QoS cannot be supported by the 802.11e Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol because of the unsolved competition between WLANs that operate in an unlicensed spectrum. A stage-based game model is introduced here in which WLANs are modeled as players. A player represents a Quality of Service Basic Service Set (QBSS). The interaction of the players within the Single Stage Game (SSG) is analytically modeled and evaluated with simulation.

A Packet Scheduler with Forward Equilibrium and Adaptive Fair Selection Method in Wireless Multimedia Traffic Environment
Kunmin Yeo, Byung-Han Ryu, and Soon-Young Lim
Abstract  In this paper, a self-adaptive algorithm of a packet scheduler is addressed as a crucial method of high-speed transmission of multimedia traffic in a shared wireless link, in accordance with new architectural functions. In the slot budget that is updated sequentially in the order of priorities of applications and sessions, adaptive modulation and coding options are considered to take into account radio links subject to fading and interference. The dedicated local packet scheduler that is in control of each type of application employs an application-sensitive scheduling algorithm. For real-time scheduler, the forward-equilibrium algorithm is introduced to consider the future state of delay. When it comes to non real-time scheduler, the adaptive-fair-selection algorithm is developed to provide the fairness between sessions. The global packet scheduler manages the overall operation of the dedicated local packet schedulers and supervises the slot budget in each transmis
 sion-time-interval making a final decision. The scheduler can provide the local fairness between sessions in each service class. Related to the bounds on delay, real-time sessions can be served with predefined requirements at the cost of increased packet dropping rates. Implementation complexity is thought to be simple, providing a low-complexity algorithm in the local scheduler for the nonreal-time class.

Performance comparison of three Call Admission Control algorithms in a Wireless Ad-Hoc Network
Giuseppe Razzano, Antonio Curcio
Abstract Three connection admission control (CAC) algorithms are described and compared via computer simulations by referring to the novel WIND-FLEX wireless LAN, recently developed in the framework of an European IST project. The three CAC solutions employ different strategies to estimate the link utilization, thus giving different performance in terms of number of refused connections and network throughput. The first solution is characterized by reduced complexity but unsatisfactory performance. The other two methods, based on a stochastic approach of the link estimation, exhibit much better performance at a reasonable complexity increase. So, they are good candidates for practical applications.

Spatial Division Multiplexing of Space-time Block Codes
Stéphanie Rouquette-Léveil , Karine Gosse, Xiangyang Zhuang, Frederick W. Vook
Abstract  In this paper we propose to derive benefit from multiple antennas to achieve high data rates using a Spatial Division Multi-plexing (SDM) based scheme combined with Space-Time Block Coding (STBC). This scheme allows to transmit simultaneously ___ different streams from _ antennas, each stream being encoded using a STBC designed for _ outputs. Spatial Division Multiplexing of Space-Time
Block Codes provides a reduced data rate compared to the classical SDM technique. However the performance gain provided by space-time block coding allows to transmit higher order constellations and then to design multiple antenna systems with same spectral efficiency and better performance. Performance of this scheme is assessed by simulations in the indoor 5GHz OFDM-based WLAN environment (IEEE802.11a, HIPERLAN/2).

The Role of Ad hoc Networking in Future Wireless Communications
Bangnan Xu, Sven Hischke
Abstract This paper discusses the role of ad hoc networking in future wireless communications. Ad hoc networks are classified as isolated ad hoc networks with large and small sizes, integrated ad hoc networks in various scenarios and cellular ad hoc networks for the future mobile access networks. The very low traffic performance of large scale ad hoc networks is shown by simulation results, indicating such a kind of networks having little commercial potential. Small size ad hoc networks seem to be ubiquitous because of the availability of cheap wireless LAN tech-nologies. Integration of small size ad hoc networks with the global Internet can be realized by ad hoc gateways, that are proposed in this paper. In contrast to large scale isolated ad
hoc networks, traffic performance of a cellular ad hoc network is very promising, indicating that cellular ad hoc networking seems to be a promising solution to fulfill the requirements of future wireless communication systems.

Interaction between UMTS MAC Scheduling and TCP Flow Control Mechanisms
Matthias Malkowski, Silke Heier
Abstract  The goal of the Universal Mobile Telecommuni-cation System (UMTS) is the delivery of multimedia services to the mobile user. Each different service requires its specific Quality of Service (QoS) to satisfy the mobile user. The QoS requirements will be supported by several protocol layers. In this paper, the interaction between the Medium Access Control (MAC) scheduling and the Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) flow control mechanisms at the UMTS radio interface is presented. Whereas the MAC is responsible to guarantee delay and throughput requirements at the radio interface, TCP realizes an end-to-end flow control. Nevertheless both protocols show dependencies on each other that might reduce the data transmission efficiency. In this paper, the overall performance of Internet applications running over TCP by using different MAC scheduling strategies is discussed. A UMTS Radio Interface Simulator (URIS) is used to emulate the standardized UMTS protocol stack and the TCP/IP protocol suite. Simulation results of QoS parameters depict the perfor-mance of mobile applications over UMTS.

Adaptive Scheduling and Coding for Time-varying Links
Yaxin Cao, Victor O. K. Li
Abstract   In dealing with wireless link variability, adaptive scheduling and adaptive coding each has its own advantages and disadvantages. These two approaches were mostly used separately. Existing work on wireless scheduling usually uses a coarse two-state link model and assumes perfect link knowledge, while work on adaptive coding ignores bandwidth sharing among users. In reality, multiple users with time-varying and location dependent links share the transmission bandwidth in a wireless network, and the two approaches need to be integrated to achieve better utilization and finer fairness granularity. In this paper, we design a simple scheme that combines the adaptive scheduling and coding mechanisms. The scheme is applicable to general Multiple-state Markov link model and enables tradeoff between bandwidth utilization and fairness granularity. Link state estimation and prediction errors are accounted for in decision-making. We also show that the optimal solution for maxi
 mizing bandwidth utilization is a special case of the general scheme.

A Novel Traffic Model Based on Wavelet analysis
Hong Fei, Wu Zhime
Abstract Recent research shows network traffic exhibits drastically different statistics according to scales. At large time scales, nearly Gaussian marginals and Long range dependence and highly non-Gaussian marginals and multifractal scaling on small scales. Structure network researchers show there are two components of the traffic according to the speed of connections, one component holds most traffic and being mostly Gaussian, the other absorbs virtually all the small scale bursts. For better understanding of this phenomenon, we propose a novel traffic model based on wavelet. Simulation results with the real traffic show this model is flexible and parsimonious to accommodate Gaussian as well as bursty behavior on different scales.

Solution Space and its Impact on Loss Tomography
Weiping Zhu
Abstract---Loss tomography aims to obtain the loss rate for each link in a network by end-to-end measurement. Based on loss rates we can understand the traffic flows and identify bottlenecks in a network. All methods proposed in the past relies on statistical inference to obtain loss rates from observations conducted at end nodes, and most of them are based on the maximum likelihood estimate to find a solution. However, there is a lack of studying the soution space of the statistical inference, which creates uncertainty for the lo rates identified by this approach since the solution could trap to a local maximum. In this paper, we reformulate the inference processing into a non-linear

Iterative Informed Audio Data Hiding Scheme Using Optimal Filter
Alejandro LoboGuerrero, Patrick Bas, Joël Liénard
Abstract- Audio watermarking is a method that allows the insertion of an imperceptible mark on an audio data set. Although the watermarking is often used to guarantee copyrights, it can also be used to increase the information transmitted in a communication context. In typical watermarking applications, the audio data set represents the host that supports the embedded information and it is considered as "noise". However, we can use the fact that this signal is not random but completely known at the transmitter to reduce imperceptibility and improve robustness. Based on
this idea, we derive a model from a classical data transmission technique and we take advantage of the knowledge of the host information to design an informed embedding scheme. This model has been then improved using an iterative controlling of the transmitted power and optimal filter. This informed embedding scheme allows us to provide a robust data-hiding system for several treatments, and it's compared to non
informed and matched filter embedding schemes.

Yunshan Ge
Abstract In this paper, we have studied the Space-Time Trellis Code(STTC) design in OFDM system. By the research, especially by simulation, it is shown that in multi-flat fading channels, the STTC OFDM system can potentially provide more code gain. We also found that the optimal STTC design is important for OFDM when using Space-Time Code(STC). By following this conclusion, an improved STTC is designed. Computer simulations have demonstrated the significant performance improvement of our proposed STTC-OFDM over the conventional STTC-OFDM. Further research for STTC-OFDM system in other channels can also be pursued according to this scheme.

Robustness Performance of the Internet Connectivity Under Targeted Attacks
Damien Magoni
Abstract-Recent advances in scale free networks have claimed that their topologies are ver weak against attacks. The inhomogeneous connectivity distribution of large scale current communication networks, such as the Internet, could be exploited by evil hackers in order to damage these systems. However there has not been many studies on the approaches and consequences of such targeted attacks. In this paper, we propose an in-depth study of the Internet topology robustness to attacks at the network layer. Several attacking techniques are presented as well as their effects on the connectivity of the Internet. We show that although the removal of a small fraction of nodes(less than 10%) can damage the Internet connectivity, such a node removal attack would still require a large amount of work to be carried out.

Abstract  In this paper, we apply a new error-correcting code   low-density parity-check (LDPC) code as the efficient channel coding technique in image communication on Rayleigh fading channel. The LDPC schemes with two different code lengths and two different code rates are simulated. Results show that LDPC codes have very good performance in image recovering over Rayleigh fading channel. By using a regular LDPC code with parameter R=1/2 and N=2048, the image can be recovered perfectly at about 5.5dB with rather low time delay and system complexity.

Hong Fei, Wu Zhimei
Abstract Recent measurement studies show that the burstiness of packet traffic in LAN as well as WAN is associated with self-similar and long-range dependent. In this paper, we analysis them using discrete wavelet transform, and describe the nature of the wavelet coefficients and their statistical properties. Then we present an adaptive, efficient unbiased estimation of Hurst index based on multiresolution wavelet analysis and weighted regression. Simulation results based on Fractal Gaussian Noise(FGN) and real traffic data reveal the proposed adaptive approach shows more accuracy and robustness than traditional methods which has only O(N)computation. Thus our algorithm can be applied to the real-time application of traffic enforcement and congestion control in high-speed networks.

SPECTRUM ANALYSIS OF NONLINEAR DISTORTION
OF RF POWER AMPLIFIERS FOR WIRELESS SIGNALS
Chunming Liu [1] , Heng Xiao [2] , Qiang Wu [3] , Fu Li [1]
ABSTRACT-One of the critical and costly components in digital cellular communication systems is the RF power amplifier. Theoretically, one of the main concerns in an RF power amplifier design is the nonlinear effect of the amplifier. Quantitatively, no explicit relationship or expression currently exists between the out-of-band emission level and the nonlinearity description related to the third-order intercept point ( 3 IP ). Further, in experiments and analysis, it was discovered that, in some situations, using 3 IP only is not accurate enough to describe the spectrum regrowth, especially when the fifth-order intercept point ( 5 IP ) is relatively high compared to the third-order intermodulation. In this article, we analyze the nonlinear effect of an RF power amplifier in CDMA (IS-95 Standard), TDMA (IS-54 Standard) and Motorola iDEN system, give an expressions of the estimation of the out -of-band emission levels for each system expressed by power spectrum respectively, in
  terms of the 3 IP and the 5 IP , as well as the power level of the signal. This result will be useful in the design of RF poweramplifier for these wireless communication systems.

Abstract In this pape r, the novel combination scheme for Adaptive Modulation & Coding (AMC) and Space-Time Block Code (STBC) in which Turbo code is used, namely AMC(Turbo)/STBC, is proposed for the high data rate transmission. Considering the soft input to the iterative Turbo decoder, two soft decision methods to get the bit soft information under Maximum Likelihood (ML) criteria have been studied.

for Designing IIR Digital Filters
Gexiang Zhang Weidong Jin Fan Jin
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called multi-criterion satisfactory optimization method (MCSOM) to design infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. The core of the method is that multiple criterions can be adjusted conveniently, according to different requirements of different designers for performances of pass bands, stop bands and transition bands of IIR digital filters. The method can be employed directly in frequency domain. By designing performance specification satisfactory rate functions and synthesis satisfactory rate function of IIR digital filters, satisfactory optimization model is constructed. The model is characterized by considering satisfactory design of performance specifications and optimization of parameters of IIR digital filters, simultaneously. Furthermore, a new quantum genetic algorithm (NQGA) is also proposed to search automatically satisfactory solution in IIR digital filter design in this paper. Rapid convergence and good global search ca
 pability characterize the performance of NQGA. The effectiveness, applicability and flexibility of MCSOM based on NQGA are demonstrated by experimental results on the lowpass and bandpass IIR digital filters design. The results show that the introduced method is superior to Yule-Walk method and the method in reference [7].

Adaptive Turbo Coded Modulation for OFDMT Transmissions
Abstract-We propose a fixed-power adaptive turbo coded modulation scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In this paper, we first observe that turbo coded modulation provides more than 15dB signal-noise-ratio(SNR) gain on uncoded OFDM in fading channels. Then we conclude that when the transmission rate is adapted to the channel adequately, adapting the power as well yields a negligible capacity gain for adaptive OFDM from  numerical simulation results. An adaptive OFDM scheme based on subband adaptation is given  and mode allocation algorithm based on the capacity evaluation of current subband is presented. Simulation results show that our adaptive OFDM scheme exhibits a more than 7.5dB SNR gain relative to non-adaptive turbo coded modulation. We also discuss the effect of feedback delay and channel estimation error on bit-error-rate(BER) performance of our adaptive scheme.

Power Allocation Between Layers in Multilayered Space-Time Coding
Cui Xiaowei, Feng Zhenming
Abstract  Multilayered space-time coded modulation is an approach of combining array processing and space-time coding. Because different coded layers have different diversity gain, so unequal power levels should be allocated to the different coded layers for achieving best performance. This paper transforms the power allocation problem into two standard optimization problems. Simulation results demonstrate that new power allocation is 2~2.5dB better than equal power manner and 0.5~1 dB better than experiential scheme in [5].

Fast MAP Decoding Algorithm for Variable Length Codes
Chen Fan, Huijuan Cui, Kun Tang
Abstract Since MAP decoding algorithm for variable length codes (VLC) is computational impractical, a fast algorithm is proposed in this paper, which simplifies the trellis representation for VLC so that the number of states is bounded by a constant, thus the computational complexity of the MAP decoding algorithm is significantly reduced, asymptotically from 2 () O n to () O n. In simulations, only a slight performance degradation of the fast algorithm relative to exact MAP decoding is observed, while it runs about 6 times faster than exact MAP decoding.

A Proof of Security of Quantum Key Distribution in Probabilistic Clone Scheme
SHENG-MEI ZHAO, FEI LI and BAO-YU ZHENG
Abstract  A probabilistic clone/resend attack strategy is proposed in this paper. Detailed analysis on the security of quantum key distribution under this attack strategy shows that the maximum information leaking to Eve is 83.4%, and the bit error rate of the sifted key is 16.6%. However, by either discarding the key distribution according to the security criteria of quantum bit error rate for quantum key distribution protocol or distilling a secret key with the privacy amplification technique, the quantum key distribution still has an asymptotic perfect security. Simulations on the procedure of quantum key distribution under the proposed attack strategy show the same results.

Transmitter Identification Using Embedded Spread Spectrum Sequences
Xianbin Wang, Yiyan Wu and Bernard Caron
Abstract A transmitter identification system using embedded spread spectrum sequence is proposed in this paper. Principles of the proposed technique is illustrated
through an example of digital TV (DTV) transmitters identification. Code generators in Matlab are developed to study the auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties of the Gold and Kasami sequences. Spread spectrum sequences with different periods are generated and simulated. To speed-up the identification process, the embedded spread spectrum sequence is preferred to be time-synchronized with the DTV signal. By doing so, code length has to be truncated before it is fitted into each field of the ATSC DTV signal. The impact of truncation noise and in-band DTV interference on transmitter identification is also investigated in this paper. It is shown that the auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties are only slightly affected by truncation noise. It is also shown that the dominant interference to the transmitter identification is the in-band DTV signal. The signal to truncation noise ratio and signal to DTV interference ratio in the correlation output are derived 
 and verified from the simulation results. It is further recognized that in-band DTV interference can only be mitigated by increasing the code length or by time-domain averaging technique to smoothen out the in-band interference.

Abstract  In this paper, a novel coarse acquisition method based on Wavelet Transform (WT ) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN ) is proposed in order to increase the detection probability of the code acquisition system. In the proposed scheme, the transient behaviors of the input signal are extracted and the characteristic parameters, signal power and phase, are acquired by WT. By means of these characteristic parameters, a template matching is performed in the artificial neural network for identification. Simulation results show a dramatic reduction in the false alarm and miss detection rate when synchronization is acquired through using the proposed scheme, compared to the traditional pure energy accumulation synchronization method.

Abstract In this paper, a new digital watermarking algorithm is presented. In this algorithm, the watermark embedded in image is constructed by several harmonics with known frequencies. When detected, the harmonics frequencies of the watermark extracted from the watermarked image will be estimated and compared with the original watermark. If the estimated and the original frequencies are equal within the
permitted error limits, we say it is a successful detection. Because the harmonic estimating algorithm used in the paper can deal with complicated additive noise, the watermark algorithm presented in the paper is rather robust. Simulation results are provided to support the algorithm.

Zhuo Chen , Branka Vucetic , Jinhong Yuan , and Ka Leong Lo
Abstract-In this paper we investigate a scheme combining transmit-antenna selection (TAS) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) (TAS/MRC). In this scheme a single antenna is chosen for transmission among all available transmit antennas and MRC is performed at the receiver side. The bit error rate (BER) of the TAS/MRC scheme is derived for binary phase-shift-keying (BPSK) in _at Rayleigh fading channels. The analysis shows that the TAS/MRC scheme can achieve the full diversity as if all the transmit antennas were used. The simulation shows that this scheme signi_cantly outperforms the space-time block codes (STBCs) of the same diversity order with the same spectral efciency.

Formal Veri_cation of Communication Protocol using Type Theory
Xingyuan Zhang, Xiren Xie  Malcolm Munro   Mark Harman, Lin Hu
Abstract-In this paper, an approach is proposed to verify communication protocol using the type theoretical proof assistant Coq. Compared with existing methods of protocol veri_cation, this approach is based directly on the simple notion of event trace. Without the burden of embedding external concurrent languages such as process algebra, _nite state machine, temporal logic, etc., this approach leads to very ef_cient reasoning. The approach is deliberately designed to exploit the computational mechanism intrinsic to type theory so that many cases can be proved automatically by computation. Because of these advantages, even non-trivial protocols can be veri_ed within reasonable cost. This paper shows that both safeness and liveness can be formalized and veri_ed using only _nite event traces. A simpli_ed version of the sliding window protocol is used to illustrate the approach. All the results presented in this paper have been mechanically checked in Coq. The relevant Coq scrip
 ts are accessible through Internet.

Using Collaborative Knowledge Base to Realize Adaptive Message Filtering in Collaborative Virtual Environment 
CHEN Ling CHEN Gen-Cai YE Chen-Guang CHEN Chuen 
Abstract  In Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE), users need to do some collaborative work, which is highly synchronous. To achieve effective collaboration, the Level Of user behavior's simulation Accuracy (LOA) in CVE must be high. But if we adopt static high LOA, system's scalability will be greatly decreased. So scalability request must compromise with collaborative request. This paper analysis CVE system's scalability request and collaborative request, and presents a classification of collaborative work and a definition of Collaborative Knowledge Base (CKB). Based on CKB, a knowledge-based adaptive message filtering technique, which improves CVE system's scalability, is put forward.

Ying Liu, Xiaofang Zhou
Abstract: Texture feature extraction is an important part in content-based image retrieval system. This paper describes a simple and effective texture feature extraction algorithm. Previous work based on image decomposition techniques usually use mean and variance of each sub-band in decomposition domain to form texture descriptor. The proposed texture descriptor uses the variance information and the luminance property of the texture to form the descriptor. Experimental results on the Brodatz texture database show that the proposed descriptor can provide comparable retrieval performance with approximately only half the number of features used compared with previous work.

User Perceived Codec and Duplex Aware Playout Algorithms and LMOS-DMOS Measurement for Real Time Streams
Kuo-Kun Tseng, Ying-Dar Lin
Abstract In the network devices for real time streaming, e.g. VoIP phone, video phone and online game, the playout algorithm controls the playout delay to eliminate the jitter and to minimize the overflow packet loss. Conventional algorithms did this based on network delay only; they did not consider the user perceived quality, and aware the codec and communication duplex mode. Therefore, we present two novel approaches: codec aware adaptive playout (CAAP) and duplex aware adaptive playout (DAAP), they intent to optimize the user perceived quality based on codec and communication duplex mode respectively. Because of their different characteristics, CAAP and DAAP can work either alone or together; and their improvements are accumulative. The out-performance of CAAP and DAAP are superior the prior algorithms in our substantial but conservative evaluation. Since no objective mechanisms for measuring the speech quality of two-way communication exist; a new LMOS-DMOS measurement m
 echanism is also proposed. Although VoIP is an exemplary embodiment in this paper, we formally model our algorithms into a generalized user perceived QoS control as well.

An Object Replacement Strategy for Global Performance in Distributed Web Caching
M.N. Wijesundara, T.T.Tay
Abstract  The novel feature in the Distributed Web Caching System we developed is that every client node could act as a cache server and share its cache with neighboring nodes. In this paper we address the problem of object replacement in distributed web caches. The problem is a version of the knapsack problem which is known to be NP-hard. We propose a heuristic based approach to the problem termed Distributed Web Caching for Global Performance (DWCG). Using event driven simulations, we show that in a Distributed Web Caching environment, the proposed strategy can outperform conventional uncooperative caching strategies such as LFU, LRU and GDSF in terms of LSR, HR and BHR.

A WS-Inspection Based Decentralized Service Discovery Service in OGSA
Jiang Du, Niansheng Zhou, Zhihui Du, Xiaoge Wang
Abstract Grid Service Discovery (GSD) is an important part of the newly proposed OGSA (Open Grid Services Architecture). This paper describes the implementation of a specific GSD service which is realized as an extended part of the OGSI Technology Preview. OGSI (Open Grid Services Infrastructure) has implemented the fundamental interfaces of OGSA. It provides a Container Registry Service for the query in Grid services. However, this service does not provide full flexibility for GSD, since it only supports querying among services registered to the local service container. The implemented GSD service is a decentralized one and is based on WS-Inspection. It is designed as a high-level service, which is based upon the Container Registry Service, provided in OGSI, so that direct access towards low-level data structure is avoided. The implementation details will be discussed in this paper, including the whole GSD mechanism and some more specific discovery methods used. Some further
 ing issues on the GSD implementation will also be discussed in this paper: Analysis on parallel and sequential searching algorithms will be given in a separate section, based on an ideal k-way tree model of the Grid topology. Other possible improvements of the GSD service will be discussed as well, for example, a better use of the WSIL to extend the flexibility of the GSD service.

Abstract A novel video multicast instant source authentication model based on digital video watermarking and TESLA (Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication) protocol is proposed in this paper. The digital watermark, which composes of the MAC (Message Authentication Code) of the significant video content, the key and instant authentication data, is embedded into the insignificant video component by the MLUT (Modified Look-Up Table) video watermarking technology. So the video packets can be authenticated instantly without large volume buffer in the receivers. In addition, we give a method to calculate the key disclosure delay (number of intervals).

An IP DiffServ Framework For Real-time Video Transmission
Min Chen, Gang Wei, and Xiaosong Zhu
Abstract This paper presents an improved IP differentiated services (DiffServ) framework which is suitable for real-time video transmission. Especially, we investigate MPEG-4 video transmission. Based on the feature of MPEG-4 flow and the extent of network congestion, implements a new DiffServ marking algorithm. In the border router, we propose a new scheduling algorithm, called the Bit-based Weight time Slot Compensate (BWSC) scheduling algorithm, which dynamically adjust the weighted quantum of service. Under the condition that network bandwidth can't guarantee the demand of MPEG-4 real-time transmission, the PSNR comparison of restored MPEG-4 video frame sequence verifys our method has much more better performance than Best-effort network. End-to-end delay and delay jitter also meet the real-time transmission demand in the improved DiffServ network.

Efficient Pitch Predictor Algorithm in ITU-T G.723.1
Chunmao Zhang, Kun Tang, Huijuan Cui, Wen Du, Jing Li
Abstract The application and implementation of ITU-T G.723.1 speech codec is narrowly limited because of the high computational complexity. A new close-loop pitch search algorithm is presented in this paper. This algorithm is still based on the 5-order pitch predictor. A Wiener-Hopf equation is established from the 20-dimension vector which is used in the 20-dimention codebook search in G.723.1 algorithm. The equation is further simplified into a Toeplitz equation and the resolution is exactly the optimal pitch predictor gain and is vector quantized with a 5-dimension vector codebook. The synthesized speech quality degrades slightly and the code is compatible with the G.723.1 algorithm while the computational complexity decreases near a half.

A New Approach to Lossless Image Compression
*Chin-Chen Chang, *Chih-Ping Hsieh, and **Ju-Yuan Hsiao
Abstract- In this paper, we shall propose a lossless image compression method based on Base Switching Transformation (BST). In order to lower down the difference between the minimum and maximum pixel values of each block used in BST and reduce the number of bits that BST needs, the first step we take is to modify each pixel value of the original image by subtracting the value of the neighboring pixel from it. The reason is that the pixel values of two neighboring pixels are usually very close to each other. Besides, we provide a hierarchical concept for the BST method. It can effectively improve the compression ratio. With our experimental results, we have made a comparison among our method, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) compression method, and Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group (JBIG) compression method, in which our method proves to be superior.

A Multicast Congestion Control Scheme for Heterogeneous Receivers
FAN Rui, CHENG Shi-duan
Abstract: Congestion control for large multicast groups has been a challenging issue for widespread deployment of multicast services. Single-rate multicast congestion control schemes address both TCP-friendly and scalability issues with low complexity. However, they do not solve the well-known "drop-to-zero" problem, i.e., to prevent a slow receiver from slowing down faster receivers in the same multicast group. For this purpose, we propose a new single-rate multicast congestion control mechanism for heterogeneous receivers which helps each multicast receiver to receive at its desired rate. The basic idea is as follows. Each multicast receiver maintains and adjusts a window at itself just like what TCP source does. They calculate a desirable receive rate with this window and the RTT to the source and feed back this rate to the source and intermediate routers. The sender tunes its rate according to the fastest receiver in the group. Each multicast router does not copy each inc
 oming multicast packet to all egress links in the multicast tree unconditionally but copy packet to egress links according to the rate information obtained from the downstream receivers. 'Good' egress links receive more packets while 'bad' egress links receive less packets. The proposed strategy is shown to be still TCP-friendly and scalable while eliminating the "drop-to-zero" problem..

Abstract In this paper, a novel marking algorithm for IP Diffserv based on the transmission condition and the different importance of video streams for decoder has been introduced. Using the marking algorithm, video transmission over the IP DiffServ networks model which we have set up has been studied. Combined with the error concealment technology in the video decoder, in case of severe congestion which cause losing a lot of IP packets, the algorithm has been proved effective, hence the delay, jitter and the perceived picture quality entirely meet requirement for real-time video transmission.

CUPS: Coupon-based Unequal Protection Scheme for Delivering Multimedia over Internet
Guangnong Song, Yongxiang Zhao, Changjia Chen
Abstract-Today, delivering multimedia information over Internet becomes more popular. But the best-effort nature of Internet and the lack of congestion control for streaming applications in Internet pose the major challenges in transferring multimedia over Internet. In this paper, we first point out that the sub-structures in a coded multimedia stream have different importance in video reconstruction. Then a new TCP friendly scheme named as Coupon-based Unequal Protection Scheme(CUPS) is proposed to enlarge the network transmission efficiency and improve the video reconstruction quality (measured by PSNR) by providing unequal protection to different structures in a coded media stream. Different from traditional unequal protection schemes[4,5,6], CUPS is implemented in transport layer instead of application layer. By taking MPEG-coded streams as our examples, the absolute protection mode and the relative protection mode are introduced to provide protection of different granula
 rities to streaming flows. Extensive simulation work is conducted to verify the performance of our scheme. And the simulation results show that our scheme can effectively provide unequal protection to different sb-streams inside a streaming flow.

Streaming Media over Peers in a Multi-path Way
Xiaoyu Zhang, Yuzhuo Zhong
Abstract   Heterogeneity of network metrics, net work dynamics and reliability are crucial issues for the efficiency of media streaming in group communication. To combat with these issues, we propose a novel approach to stream media over peers in a multi-path way, based on FEC (Forward Error Correction) technique. The proposed method enlarges system capacity by breaking through available bottleneck bandwidth, improves reliability against node failure, and is more resilient to the fluctuation of network metrics. Extensive simulations were conducted and the results clearly support the claimed advantages.

A Color Image Progressive Transmission Method by Common Bit Map Block Truncation Coding Approach
Chin-Chen Chang, Ming-Ni Wu 
Abstract This paper proposes a new progressive image transmission (PIT) scheme for color images. The backbone of the new method is block truncation coding (BTC). The common BTC bit map will be employed to reduce the bit rate and to accelerate the transmission process; moreover, a break cluster method will also be put to use to speed up the division of the block tree. It can be a rather complex job to deal properly with color images transmitted progressively; therefore, to make it easier and faster, we shall count on the BTC method. Our experimental results show that our new algorithm, with a lower bit rate and higher reconstructed image quality, obviously outperforms the BPM and traditional BTC methods. The high PSNR results in most phases can help the user decide whether to wait for more of the current image to come out or to abort the transmission session as quickly as possible. 


An Enhanced Buyer Seller Watermarking Protocol
Chin-Chen Chang, Chi-Yien Chung
Abstract-Digital watermarks are helpful about the possession identification as well as copyright and intellectual property protection for tons and tons of multimedia data transmitted through the Internet. In a buyer-seller watermarking protocol, both seller and buyer have to insert their watermarks into a copy. If unauthorized parties have drifted into market, the watermark detection and extraction algorithm will both identify exactly who has the legal ownership of that copy and trace back to the illegal reseller. In Memon and Wong's protocol, the seller is responsible for watermarks insertion, but she/he has no idea what the buyer's watermark is. As a result, the seller has no way to forge the buyer's watermark. However, the seller doesn't have to use her/his own private information in the watermark insertion process. This may bring about the problem of man in the middle attack. Besides, in their protocol, if there is a dispute, a judge is a must. To improve those shortcomin
 gs, we shall propose a new scheme where the seller has to use her/his own private key to do the watermark insertion job. In our scheme, everyone can be the judge if there is a quarrel over the copyright. This provides a simple and fair solution to the judgment of copy deterrence.

Abstract Congestion control mechanism for multicast is one of the key problems of designing multicast protocol. In this paper, a congestion control mechanism for multicast is presented: RBMCC, which based rate and initiated by both sender and receiver. RBMCC uses three factors (loss rate of receivers, aggregated ACK of intermediate nodes and TCP-friendly rate computed by sender) to provide timely and accurate response on behalf of congestion. Experiment results show that RBMCC is scaleable and TCP-friendly.

FJM: Fast Join Mechanism for End Host Multicast
Sungyean Cho, Myong-Soon Park
Abstract We propose Fast Join Mechanism to search potential parents for new members in End Host Multicast. An existing method searches EM-tree one step at a time to find a potential parent. The existing search method causes long join latency. To search quickly, we search EM-tree two steps at a time. In other words, we search children and grand-children at the same time. We look at the performance of Fast Join Mechanism using the following metrics: cost and search time by the number of group members and degree limit. Simulation results show that our mechanism searches potential parents faster than the existing method.

In practical applications, however, the performance of receiver is much degraded due to the so-called near-far problem. Based on the theory of blind signal separation(BSS), this paper presents a new multiuser detector, which substantially enhances the near-far re- sistance ability of the receiver. The proposed method solves the order ambiguity inherent in the BSS problem by utilizing the structure in- formation of the effective signature waveform. Finally, its performances are confirmed by com- puter simulations.

Traffic Channel SIR Estimation Based on Reverse Pilot Channel
Zhouhua
Abstract Signal-to-Interference Ratio(SIR) is a very important metric of communication link quality. For wireless cellular systems, several control mechanism, such as power control, rate control, and allocation of radio resource are based on SIR estimation. In previous research [1]-[5], most of researches concentrate on WCDMA system in which pilot symbol is time-multiplexed with data symbol, this method is not feasible for cdma2000 system where pilot symbol is code-multiplexed with data symbol. This paper first develops SIR estimators based on reverse pilot channel and then derives the approximate analytic expression for its mean squared error (MSE) function, the accuracy of which is validated through simulation. It is shown that the MSE of the new SIR estimator is significantly smaller than the MSE of other widely used SIR estimators, especially in low SIR case.

Direction-Finding of Cyclostationary Sources With Minimum-Redundancy Linear Arrays By Fourth-Order Cyclic Cumulants
Hong Jiang, Shuxun Wang
Abstract Most communication signals exhibit cyclo-stationarity and the overall number of signals impinging on the array is often greater than the number of sensors. In this paper, considering these, we propose a direction-finding algorithm to detect non-Gaussian cyclostationary sources by designing minimum-redundancy linear arrays (MRLA's) based on fourth-order cyclic cumulants using ESPRIT. Simulation results show that our method can effectively suppress additive stationary noise and Gaussian noise in environments where the spatial characteristics of noise are unknown, even when the noise shares the same cycle frequency as the signals of interests (SOI's). Moreover, compared with the designed fourth-order cyclic cumulants method using uniform linear array (ULA), the MRLA method is proved to provide better performance in terms of ability to detect and resolve a greater number of sources. More than 2M -2 sources can be estimated with M sensors.

Fractionally spaced channel estimation and equalization for synchronous DS-CDMA downlink with aperiodic spreading code
Lu Jingyang, Wu Weiling
Abstract Synchronous code-division multiple-access (CDMA) techniques possess intrinsic protection against co-channel interference when orthogonal codes are used. However, in the presence of multipath propagation, the signals lose their orthogonality property, leading to increased cross correlation. In these cases, channel estimation may be needed in order to improve detection. The former algorithms to estimation the channel response of CDMA system are used for signal sampled with chip rate. The received signal sampled in chip rate does not satisfy the Nyquist theory and the channel may be not a minimum-phase system that the former algorithms don't work. We propose algorithms for fractionally spaced channel estimation and equalization of a synchronous CDMA system that uses aperiodic spreading code. Simulations have demonstrated the performance of proposed algorithm.

Moving Object Segmentation for Video Surveillance and Conferencing Applications
Falah E. Alsaqre, Yuan Baozong
Abstrac???? Video surveillance and conferencing systems have an impressive spread both for their practical application and interest as research issue. The common approach used in such systems consists of a good segmentation of moving objects. This paper presents an algorithm for segmenting and extracting moving objects suitable for surveillance and videoconferencing applications, where a still background frame can be captured beforehand. Since edge detection are often used to extract accurate boundaries of the objects in the scene, the first step in our algorithm is accomplished by combining two kinds of edge points which are detected from the frame difference and the background subtraction. After removing edge points that belong to the background frame, the resulting moving edge map is fed to the object extracting step. A fundamental task in this step is to declare the candidates of the moving object, followed by applying morphological closing and opening operations. The alg
 orithm is implemented on a real video sequences and good segmentation performance is achieved.

Practical analysis of watermarking capacity
YU Nenghai, CAO liangliang, FANG Wen, LI Xuelong, 
Abstract Digital watermarking embedding is a hot research field of image processing. Digital watermarking is only possible because our vision system is not perfect. A number of applications have emerged such as copyright notification, time stamp and automated monitoring. There have been ingenious works on watermarking capacity [1] [3], which all assume the attack distortion are Gaussian additive distribution. We argue that these results are beautiful but not practical. It is hard to classify different attacking methods into a uniform format (especially as Gaussian distribution). In the other hand, the capacity of a given image's information is an interesting and important topic. In stead of conventional analysis based on non-precise assumption of attack distortion, this paper concentrate on the problem how much information that image can carry without much visibility distortion. Our work is based on wavelet transform and mean-squared error since we believe they are representa
 tive measure for most work. Comparing with the former work on the watermarking capacity, this paper pays more attention to the influence on capacity of widely used technique such as spread spectrum. In the last part of this paper, we discuss of future tends of new watermarking algorithm and their influence of capacity.

An Image Self-verification Scheme Based on the Rehash Technique
Min-Hui Lin*, Yu-Chen Hu* Chin-Chen Chang**
Abstract Nowadays images have become an important form of expression for data communication. However, if the images get tampered during the communication, their usefulness is undermined and the resending of images can bring unnecessary workload to network. Therefore, it is quite an important issue to maximize the usefulness of images even if the images have been tampered. To assure the authenticity and usefulness of images that have been tampered, this paper used modified Du et al.'s first level rehash to propose an image self-verification scheme. To increase the usefulness of tampered images, we manage to precisely identify which "pixels of the tampered images have been tampered. The rightmost two bits of every pixel are used to store the authentication information, which was derived by means of the modified HIT construct procedure proposed in modified Du et al.'s first level rehash. Before sending images, both of receiver and sender have to determine a secure key SK and sev
 eral hash functions, and then the senders can calculate the HIT value first and embed the value to the rightmost two bits of every pixel to generate an image containing self-verification information. Upon receiving such images, the receivers can conduct the same procedure to calculate the HIT values for the authentication. As the authentication information is directly embedded in the images, no extra transmission cost will occur. Thus, our scheme will not increase transmission cost and is considerably convenient in real practice as there is no special limitation on the hash function used in our scheme.

Performance Analysis of Multiple Antenna Diversity in Transmitter and Receiver over Known Channels
He Zhiqiang Tian Baoyu Wu Weiling
Abstract In this paper, we consider the situation that two antenna arrays with M and N elements are connected via a scattering medium giving uncorrelated antenna signal. The multiple antenna arrays in transmission and reception are used to combat fading and improve the data transferred rate in bandwidth limited wireless channel. It assumed that the channels status is known at the transmitter and receiver. Using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel transfer matrix, the optimum transmitter and receiver antenna array weights are determined. The bound of signal noise rate (SNR) is presented based on the singular values of the channel transfer matrix. Finally the expressions for bit error rate (BER) for non-fading as well as Rayleigh fading channel is derived when the optimal methods are used for transmission and reception.

Abstract 1-dimensional spread spectrum (1DSS) technology is widely used nowadays, such as in the DS-CDMA system, while a new column-orthogonal two dimension spread spectrum technique (2DSS) is proposed in [1]. In this paper, we will describe this kind of two dimensions spread spectrum technique in detail and represent ite strictly. Basing on the 2DSS technique, we discuss the orthogonal multicarrier communication system under Rayleigh fading channel with an additive white Gaussian noise. A closed-form expression of the bit error rate performance of this communication system is derived. Numerical result of the performance of this 2DSS multicarrier system shows its advantage in low signal noise ratio.

Capacity of Nakagami-q (Hoyt) Fading Channels with Channel Side Information
Jay Cheng and Toby Berger
Abstract---In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the channel capacity of a diversity reception system with maximal-ratio combining (MRC) or postdetection equal-gain combining (EGC) over a slowly varying Nakagami-q (Hoyt) fading channel under different adaptive transmission policies when the channel side information is available at the transmitter and the receiver. We consider the situation that the branches are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). We _rst derive three different canonical-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the instantaneous combiner output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a weighted sum of gamma PDF's. Then the channel capacity is obtained in different canonical forms as a weighted sum of channel capacities for single-branch systems in gamma fading environments.

Computation of the PAR of Continuous-Time Real-value OFDM Signal
Hua Yu, Xiang Yang, and Gang Wei
Abstract   Computation of the peak-to-average envelope power ratio (PAR) of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal plays a major role in peak reduction methods. A procedure for computing the PAR of a continuous-time real-value OFDM signal which is known as discrete multi-tone, with any PSK or QAM constellations, is developed here. It is shown that the derivative of the real-value signal waveform function (RVSWF), whose square is the instantaneous envelope power function (EPF), can be transformed into a linear sum of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and the second kind. Consequently, the roots of the derivative of RVSWF can be obtained by solving a polynomial. The procedure may be useful for theoretical studies of PAR distributions and developing the peak reduction methods.

A Comparative Study of Robust Channel Estimators for OFDM Systems
Wu Jiang, Wu Weiling
Abstract In this paper, we investigate robust channel estimation methods for OFDM systems. Three pilot-symbol-aided channel estimation schemes are discussed, i.e., the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), the estimator based on parametric channel modeling, and the least square (LS) estimation with low-pass interpolation. We analyze the complexities of the estimators and compare the mean square error (MSE) and symbol error rate (SER) over frequency-selective fading channels. It is shown that the low-pass interpolation-based estimation gives the lowest complexity among the three estimators, but its performance is not so good as the other two. The estimator based on parametric channel modeling is simpler than MLE with slightly better performance.
