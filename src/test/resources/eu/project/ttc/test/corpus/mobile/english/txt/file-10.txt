The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between switching cost, 
corporate image, trust and customer loyalty. Several hypotheses are extracted from 
the research framework and are tested using regression and correlation analysis. A 
sample of 150 respondents (customers of mobile phone operator) was used and 
convenience sampling method was conducted. The research finds that although all 
the independent variables, switching cost, corporate image, and trust have certain 
degree of relationship with the dependent variable, customer loyalty, only trust has 
the strongest relationship with customer loyalty. The findings suggests that 
mangers of these mobile operators should put more focus of building corporate 
image and analyze more carefully the reason for customers to switch brands in this 
industry in order to increase loyalty among these customers.

Introduction 
The number of mobile subscribers has been increased dramatically. Over the last two to 
three years, the number of mobile subscribers in Bangladesh has been more than or close 
to more than doubling on an annual basis. The subscriber base had reached 44 million by 
mid-2008 and was continuing to grow at an annual rate in excess of 50%. And the strong 
growth seemed likely to continue with the drive that has been developed on the back of 
the government's deregulation process. The competitive environment has further 
intensified due to the entry of new operators into the market 
(www.totel.com.au/bangladesh-telecommunications-research.asp). The telecom regulator 
also disclosed that addition of new subscribers raised the mobile penetration more than 
25% of the country's population. Individually, Bangladesh's leading mobile operator, 
Grameenphone, has 18.6 Million customers, Banglalink has 8.64 Million, AKTEL has 
7.57 Million and Warid has 2.93 Million subscribers. On the other side, Citycell, 
Bangladesh oldest mobile operator, has added 1.6 Million subscribers. The reasons 
behind this growth rate during April 2008 was largely due to declining call rates, falling 
prices of handsets and rising competition among operators. Consequently, the mobile 
phones become cheaper and affordable for people in the country with the increase in 
disposable income that improves the quality of life in Bangladesh. People are showing 
interest in new technologies like Internet service on mobile phone. Besides, mobile 
companies are also adding new technologies in their services as a result more and more 
customers are buying mobile phones. (www.rncos.com/Blog/2008/07/Bangladesh-
Telecom-Industry-Growing-at-Rapid-Pace.html).

 1 Thus it becomes a high concern for the companies to stay alive and win the market share 
by making the customer more loyal to their firms. As competition increases, customers 
bargaining power gets stronger, and building trust and image becomes more important, 
companies should put more focus on factors affecting loyalty among consumers. For this 
reason, the objective of the study is set to establish a frame work which will identify the 
impact of customer loyalty of mobile phone operators through switching cost, corporate 
image, and trust. Besides, in the context of Bangladesh, no research works has ever been 
conducted in these mentioned areas. Therefore, it is obviously a commensurate step for 
the researcher to examine the impact of switching cost, trust and corporate image on 
customer loyalty in the mobile phone operator industry in Bangladesh. 
 
The research model and hypotheses 
Figure 1 presents the research model, which concerns the relationship of three 
independent variables (switching cost, corporate image, and trust) with one dependent 
variable (customer loyalty). . Each of these components is defined as follows and their 
relationships are also portrayed in this section. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 • Switching cost 
  
 • Corporate image Customer loyalty 
 
 • Trust 
Figur e 1: Conceptual Framework of Research Variables and their Relationships 
Switching Cost 
Switching cost is defined as the cost that incurs when a consumer change one service 
provider to another service provider (Porter, 1998). According to Jackson (1985), it is the 
sum of economic, psychological and physical costs. Switching cost can be considered as 
sunk cost that appears when customer changes his/her brand.  Examples are the costs of 
closing an account with one bank and opening another with a competitor, the costs of 
changing one's long-distance telephone service or the costs of changing one's GSM 
service provider. It can happen for the lack of loyalty when a firm fails to satisfy and 
anticipate its customer's expectations and perceptions. Switching cost is also defined as 
the investment of time, money and effort that, in customers' perception, made it difficult 
 2 to switch (Gremler and Brown, 1996). In other words, it is the customer's estimate of the 
personal loss or sacrifice in time, effort and money associated with the customer 
changing to another service provider (Hellier, Rickard, Carr, and Geursen, 2002). 
 Corporate image 
First of all, image is defined as the perceptions of an organization reflected in the 
associations held in consumer memory (Keller, 1993). In the service marketing literature 
it is considered as an important factor in the overall evaluation of the service and the 
company (Bitner, 1991; Grönroos, 1984; Gummesson and Grönroos, 1988). And Bitner 
(1990) proposes corporate image as an important factor in the overall evaluation of a firm 
and is argued to be what comes to the mind of a customer when they hear the name of a 
firm (Nguyen, 2006). In another case, corporate image is described as the overall 
impression made on the minds of the public about a firm (Barich & Kotler, 1991).   
A firm has to devise strategies to get into customer mind. In other words, a company has 
to anticipate the customer's cognition in various certain ways to get its corporate image.  
Which is the result of a process (MacInnis & Price, 1987).  The process stems from ideas, 
feelings and consumption experiences with a firm that are retrieved from memory and 
transformed into mental images (Yuille & Catchpole, 1977).  Even though customers 
have no information about the firm but they can get information from another sources 
like the word of mouth, advertisements etc. which will influence the process of forming a 
corporate image.  Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) argue that attitudes are functionally related 
to behavioral intentions, which predict behavior.  Therefore, corporate image as an 
attitude must be related with the consumer behavior.   
Every customer has unique perceptions and expectations not only about the firm but also 
about the service quality provided by the firms and customer's perceptions about this 
service quality directly affect the perception of corporate image. Corporate image can be 
treated as an outcome forms an accumulated attitude that is derived from experience 
and/or direct or indirect market communication (Andreassen & Lindestad, 1998).  If the 
service quality perceived by the customers as positive or negative, it then directly affects 
its corporate image (Keller, 1993). 
Trust 
The concept trust has a wide range of use in many areas and has various definitions 
(Lewicki et al., 1998). Trust has an impact on the vulnerability of the trustor (Bigley and 
Pearce, 1998; Singh and Sirdeshmukh, 2000), because trust becomes irrelevant if there is 
no vulnerability of the trustor upon the trustee. In business studies, trust has been found 
to be important for building and maintaining long-term relationships ( Geyskens et al., 
1996; Rousseau et al., 1998; Singh & Sirdeshmukh, 2000). 
Lewis and Weigert (1985) argue that trust is not mere predictability but confidence in the 
face of risk.  Trust not only can predict the quality of the service or talk about the other 
important features associated with service but it also can negate the uncertainty involved 
in purchasing certain service or product. So trust can build confidence among the 
consumers. While there have been numerous conceptualizations of trust in the marketing 
literature, one of the more popular is that offered by Morgan and Hunt (1994, p. 23): trust 
exists "when one party has confidence in an exchange partner's reliability and integrity". 
 3 Similarly, Moorman et al. (1993, p. 82) define trust as "a willingness to rely on an 
exchange partner in whom one has confidence". 
 
Customer loyalty 
 Customer loyalty is defined as "the degree to which a customer exhibits repeat 
purchasing behavior from a service provider, possesses a positive attitudinal disposition 
toward the provider, and considers using only this provider when a need for this service 
arises" (Gremler and Brown, 1996, p. 173). It expresses an intended behavior related to the 
service or the company. This includes the possibility of future renewal of service contracts, 
how likely it is that the customer changes patronage, how likely the customer is to provide 
positive word-of-mouth, or the likelihood of customers providing voice (Andreassen and 
Lindestad, 1997). 
Jones and Sasser (1995) state that customer loyalty is "a feeling of attachment to or 
affection for a company's people, products, or services".  Customer loyalty is expressed 
as an intended behavior regarding the service or the company. The loyalty and repurchase 
intentions aspects of the taxonomy are most similar in nature. Oliver (1997), for example, 
operationalizes action loyalty as repeat usage. Furthermore, Delgado-Ballester and 
Munuera-Alema´n (2001) and Macintosh and Lockshin (1997) use repurchase intentions 
as an element of loyalty in brand and store contexts respectively. 
Relationship between Switching Costs and Customer Loyalty 
 Switching cost presents a number of benefits on companies that have a direct effect on 
customer loyalty. For example, it decreases customers' price sensitiveness and 
satisfaction level (Fornell, 1992). When customers are expected to select form a number 
of functionally identical brands, the presence of switching cost helps customers to build 
brand loyalty (Klemperer, 1987a). In many other researches, it is found that switching 
cost has a direct influence on customer sensitivity to price level and thus influences 
customer loyalty (e.g. Eber, 1999; Jones et al., 2002; Bloemer et al., 1998; Burnham et 
al., 2003; Feick et al., 2001). Fornell (1992) also argues that switching cost is one of 
many factors that affect the relationship of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. In 
other research, it is found that switching cost has a moderator effect on customer loyalty 
that is as switching cost increases, the satisfaction level decreases (Hauser et al., 1994). 
Jones et al., (2000) found switching cost as the antecedent of loyalty for both business-to-
business and business-to-consumer cases. In another research, it is proposed that high 
switching barriers or lack of real alternatives might make the customers loyal 
(Andreassen and Lindestad, 1997). 
From these literature reviews, the following hypothesis proposes that there exists a 
relationship between switching cost and customer loyalty. 
  
H1. There is a relationship between switching cost and customer loyalty. 
 
Relationship between Corporate Image and Customer Loyalty 
 4 For both existing and new customers, corporate image is an extrinsic information cue 
that may or may not influence customer loyalty (Lindestad and Andreassen, 1997). In a 
similar research, it is found that consumers may be loyal to a firm or brand because it is 
viewed as having a positive image among other consumers (Ball, Coelho, and Macha´s, 
2003). When a consumer perceive that the firm is truly service oriented, then the firm 
will have the power to enhance customers' perception of the firm's image and eventually 
gain their loyalty. Thus to enhance customer loyalty, corporate image is considered as an 
important factor and it is also found that corporate image has direct impact on and is 
positively related to customer loyalty (Kandampully and Hu, 2007). Moreover, it is found 
that customers' overall assessment of corporate image is deemed to influence customer 
loyalty (Reynolds et al., 1974-1975). 
In order to maintain market position, companies view favorable image as a critical aspect 
that has been related to core aspects of organizational success such as customer patronage 
(Granbois, 1981; Korgaonkar et al., 1985).   
Corporate image depends on the physical and behavioral attributes of the firm, such as 
the name of the corporation, architecture, products/services, and the communication skills 
of the staffs.  Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) argue that attitudes and behavioral intentions has 
functional relationship, which predict behavior.  Consequently, corporate image is 
considered as an attitude that must affect behavioral intentions such as customer loyalty 
(Johnson et al., 2001).  Nguyen and Leblanc (2001) demonstrate that in three business 
sectors (telecommunication, retailing and education), corporate image and customer 
loyalty are positively related. From these literature reviews, the following hypothesis 
proposes that there exists a relationship between corporate image and customer loyalty. 
 
H2. There is a relationship between corporate image and customer loyalty. 
 
Relationship between Trust and Customer Loyalty 
 Hart and Johnson (1999) mentioned that it is necessary to look for the variables that can 
ensure a long-term customer commitment to a single provider. One of such variable is 
trust. Gremler and Brown (1996) and Reichheld et al., 2000 proposed respectively that a 
conceptual and important antecedent of customer loyalty is trust. In similar researches, 
Garbarino and Johnson (1999) found trust as a driver of customer behavioral intentions 
that might lead to customer loyalty and Ranaweera and Prabhu (2003) found in order to 
maintain a long-term contractual relationship with the service provider, trust is likely to 
be a strong driver of customer retention. To build relationship commitment and customer 
loyalty, trust is found as one of the important factor (Morgan and Hunt, 1994, Moorman 
et al., 1993, Sharma, 2003) and also it is a critical variable logically and experientially in 
relationships (Moorman et al., 1993; Morgan and Hunt, 1994). Many other authors 
supported the importance of trust in building customer loyalty (Lim et al. 1997; 
Garbarino and Johnson, 1999; Chaudhuri and Holbrook, 2001; Singh and Sirdeshmukh, 
2000; and Sirdeshmukh et al., 2002). It is a precondition for patronage behavior (Pavlou, 
2003) and is needed to build long-term customer relationship relationships (Doney and 
Cannon, 1997; Papadopoulou et al., 2001; Singh and Sirdeshmukh, 2000). In business 
environment, to build and maintain long-term relationship, trust has been found to be a 
 5 very important factor (e.g. Geyskens et al., 1996; Rousseau et al., 1998; Singh and 
Sirdeshmukh, 2000). Trust can reduce the perceived risk of using a service (Gambetta, 
2000), it can therefore be considered as the consequence of positive evaluations of 
services and an antecedent of customer loyalty. Moreover, Foster and Cadogan (2000) 
also demonstrated that consumer trust in the company was an antecedent to attitudinal 
loyalty. Garbarino and Johnson's (1999) research proposes that for relational oriented 
customers, trust and commitment are key antecedents to loyalty. 
Many have found a direct link (e.g. Bearden and Teel, 1983; Cronin and Taylor, 1992; 
Oliver et al., 1997; Selnes, 1998), while others suggest that trust is the dominant 
antecedent of repurchase intentions (e.g. Doney and Cannon, 1997). From these literature 
reviews, the following hypothesis proposes that there exists a relationship between trust 
and customer loyalty. 
H3. There is a relationship between trust and customer loyalty. 
 
Methodology 
The apposite type of research design for this study is Ex Post Facto design where the 
subtype used is survey to accomplish the research objectives. The central objective of 
survey design is to search for relationships between variables. It usually depends upon the 
use of a well-constructed questionnaire, which is used to collect data from the relevant 
unit of analysis under study, usually, an individual (Davis & Cosenza, 1993). Thus this 
research can depict the relationship(s) of certain variables of switching cost, corporate 
image, trust and customer loyalty in the context of the customers of mobile phone 
operators in Dkaka Metropolitan City, the capital city of Bangladesh.  
The convenience sampling is one of the non-probability sampling designs that are being 
used in this research. As its name implies, convenience sampling involves collecting 
information from members of the population who are conveniently available to provide 
this information (Sekaran, 1992).  The sampling units are both male and female mobile 
phone operator customers of Dhaka city.  
Primary data have been collected from 150 samples by the use of questionnaire. Data 
collection has proceeded coding of 150 questionnaires into a symbolic form in SPSS 
software. The data was summarized in the form of simple frequency and descriptive 
statistics. As hypotheses have been tested to identify the relationship of certain variable 
those are based on the scale of ordinal data in the questionnaire, Bivariate analysis 
(Spearman's Rank Correlation test) has been used. 
A reliability test for each hypothesis, which entails the relationship of a construct and a 
dependent variable, has been conducted. The researcher has used semantic differential 
scale to measure each of the independent and dependent variable. As this scale is based 
on five points and is split into two halve, it is considered appropriate to test the reliability 
of this scale. The value of the Chronbach's alpha has been estimated to test whether the 
scales are reliable or not. A Chronbach's alpha value of between 0.5-0.6 indicates 
sufficient reliability of the scale for the early stage of any research (Nunnaly, 1978), 
although a coefficient of 0.7 or above is desirable (Hair et., 1998). Regression analysis 
has also been done to show how much variability in dependent variable is caused by the 
variability in independent variables. For lucidity, examining each hypothesis is 
encompassed into three steps: Reliability analysis, correlation analysis and regression 
analysis of the variables. 
 6 Analysis 
The first analysis has been undertaken to test the reliability of the scale that measures the 
dependent variable, customer loyalty that has been mentioned in the framework. The 
reliability analysis of this dependent variable indicates an alpha value of 0.982. 
Therefore, it can be inferred that the items that have been aggregated to measure the 
dependent variable, customer loyalty, are reliable. 
The Cronbach alpha values of reliability analysis for all the independent variables have 
been shown in table 1. 
Table 1: Independent variables and their corresponding Cronbach alpha values 
Independent variables Cronbach alpha 
Switching cost 0.692 
Corporate image 0.916 
Trust 0.916 
 
The table above indicates that the Cronbach alpha values of the independent variables are 
above 0.6. Therefore, it can be deduced that the three independent variables are reliable. 
The "bivariate" correlation test with the value of Spearman's rho assists the researcher to 
make inference regarding the relationship of the following variables (customer loyalty as 
the dependent variable, and switching cost, corporate image and trust as the independent 
variables).  
It is imperative to set the cutting point of which to select the hypotheses. Thus, the 
statistical notion implies the two conditions for accepting the hypotheses, if ρ ≠ 0 and, if 
α < 0.05. 
It can inferred from the following table that the α value (two-tail significance level test) 
for all the hypotheses tested is found substantiated at the significant level lower than 0.05 
(the actual α is 0.01). The ρ value for each of the hypotheses was found not to be equal to 
zero (refer to Table 2). Thus, all the three hypotheses have been accepted. 
 
Table 2: Significance value (α) and Correlation coefficient (ρ) of three hypotheses 
 
Hypotheses Significance value (α) Correlation coefficient (ρ) 
1 0.000 0.839 
2 0.000 0.841 
3 0.000 0.939 
 
The value of R square from table 3 suggests that variability in the dependent variable, 
customer loyalty cab be explained 89.2% by the variability in the independent variables, 
trust, switching cost, corporate image. It means that the linear combination of 
independent variables in the regression analysis predicts total variance of dependent 
variable by 89.2%.

From table 4, step-wise regression analysis shows that only one independent variable, 
trust mostly explain (88.2%) the variability in the dependent variable, customer loyalty. 
This means that the variability of dependent variable is explained only 0.8% (89.1-88.3) 
by the variability in the independent variable, switching cost and only 0.1% by the 
variability in the other independent variable, corporate image. So it can be infer that trust 
has more important role in this study than switching cost and corporate image in 
explaining the variability of customer loyalty.

Assessment of the research hypotheses 
Hypothesis 1 
There is a relationship between switching cost and customer loyalty.  
 
The result of correlation analysis illustrates that switching cost (r = 0.839, p<0.01) has a 
positive, strong and significant relationship with customer loyalty in the context of 
mobile phone operators in Bangladesh.  Thus, the result of the correlation analysis has 
provided support for this hypothesis. 
The result of stepwise regression depicts that switching cost has entered into the 
regression equation, which indicates that switching cost is significantly associated with 
customer loyalty in the context of mobile phone operators in Bangladesh. And switching 
cost alone can explain 0.8% of the total changes in customer loyalty. Therefore, the result 
of stepwise regression has provided support for the first hypothesis. 
The positive explanation behind these findings is that the customers of mobile phone 
operators in Bangladesh do have concern regarding the switching cost in showing their 
loyalty towards the company. As many mobile phone operators are currently competing 
with very competitive price and services, it gives the customers a very good chance to 
shop around. The low price of the SIM card influences the customer to switch easily and 
try all different brands. As a result, erecting high switching cost to retain the customer is 
an ineffective tool in mobile phone operating business in Bangladesh. That is why the 
variability in customer loyalty did not explained much by the variability in switching 
cost. 
 
Hypothesis 2 
There is a relationship between corporate image and customer loyalty. 
 
 8 The result of correlation analysis illustrates that corporate image (r = 0.841, p<0.01) has a 
positive, strong and significant relationship with customer loyalty in the context of 
mobile phone operators in Bangladesh.  Thus, the result of the correlation analysis has 
provided support for this hypothesis. 
The result of stepwise regression depicts that corporate image has entered into the 
regression equation, which indicates that corporate image is significantly associated with 
customer loyalty in the context of mobile phone operators in Bangladesh. And corporate 
image alone can explain 0.1% of the total changes in customer loyalty. Therefore, the 
result of stepwise regression has provided support for the second hypothesis. 
The positive explanation behind these findings is that corporate image has some influence 
in building loyalty among mobile phone operator customers in Bangladesh. Corporate 
image is the factor that is least concerned among the consumers, as a huge number of 
customers of mobile phone operators in Bangladesh is less educated and unaware of the 
companies' perceived image. Whether the company has stable condition or whether they 
have social contribution are given least priority in choosing a particular brand. Rather the 
customers prefer other objective criteria such as price, service, network coverage etc. in 
choosing brands. That is why variability in customer loyalty was explained very less by 
the variability of corporate image. 
 
 
Hypothesis 3 
There is a relationship between trust and customer loyalty. 
 
The result of correlation analysis illustrates that trust (r = 0.939, p<0.01) has a positive, 
very strong and significant relationship with customer loyalty in the context of mobile 
phone operators in Bangladesh.  Thus, the result of the correlation analysis has provided 
support for this hypothesis. 
The result of stepwise regression depicts that trust has entered into the regression 
equation, which indicates that trust is significantly associated with customer loyalty in the 
context of mobile phone operators in Bangladesh. And trust alone can explain 88.3% of 
the total changes in customer loyalty. Therefore, the result of stepwise regression has 
provided support for this hypothesis. 
The positive explanation behind these findings is that trust in the company plays a vital 
role in building loyalty among the mobile phone operator customers in Bangladesh. As 
there are many mobile phone operators currently operating in Bangladesh with very 
competitive prices and services, Bangladeshi customers have a natural tendency of 
choosing that operator that provides trustworthy services without any cheating or unfair 
practices. It means they have to trust the company first to become loyal. Unfair practices, 
cheating, unethical behavior etc all are very common and vivid pictures in Bangladesh, a 
third world country. As a result Bangladeshi consumers are very serious in choosing 
brands. Because the consumers perceive the companies might cheat on them, they always 
look for recommendation from others regarding the trustworthiness of the company. That 
is why it is found that trust plays the most important role among the consumers of mobile 
phone operators to build loyalty. 
 9 Finally, the assessment of hypotheses reveals that the trust is the most important factor 
among the others to build customer loyalty. Switching cost and corporate image also have 
impact on customer loyalty but to a very insignificant degree. 
  
Managerial implications 
The findings of this paper have implications for the manager of service firms. The 
managers can use these results to make better marketing strategies in order to attract more 
customers to the buy services. The mangers should consider factors that influence repeat 
purchase that eventually lead to customer loyalty. 
In the context of Bangladesh, it is important to build trust among the consumers 
regarding the service provider. Consumer loyalty in Bangladesh depends strongly on 
trust, it means if consumers trust the service provider, they become loyal to the brand and 
to the company. That's why to build trust among consumer; the managers should devise 
ways to build trust and should include these tactics in their marketing programs. 
Likewise, switching cost and corporate image should also be put into consideration in an 
attempt to make marketing strategies more competitive.  It is seen that consumer prefer 
certain service provider for the its reputed image. So the managers should try to enhance 
the image of the company in order to create a favorable attitude of the customers towards 
the company, which will guide to customer loyalty. To enhance image, companies should 
apply different promotional programs along with corporate social responsibility. As a 
consequence, the customers perceive the company as a good company in the society. 
Moreover, since services are intangible and based on performances, a better 
understanding of the components of image promises to help management improve the 
competitive performance of the firm. 
 
In addition, switching cost is another factor that can lead to customer loyalty. Though in 
the context of Bangladesh, variability in switching cost does not explain that much 
variability in customer loyalty of mobile phone operator business, still the mangers of 
these service providers should carefully consider switching cost factor. The managers 
should increase the level of switching cost so that the consumer cannot switch easily to 
other brands and eventually become loyal to the company. 
The findings of the research not only help managers of mobile phone operators, but also 
guide the managers of other service providing firms. Understanding the result delineate 
the fact that several factors can have considerable effect on customer loyalty. 
 Retention rate is a good indicator of customer loyalty. Increases in retention rates can 
have a significant positive effect on market share (Fornell and Wernerfelt,1988), 
(McGahan and Ghemawat, 1994) and (Rust and Zahorik ,1993). 
Furthermore, studies by Blodgett et al. (1995), Colgate et al. (1996), Hallowell (1996), 
Payne and Rickard (1997) and Rust et al. (1995) indicate that an increase in customer 
retention can have a positive effect on a company's net operating cash flow and profit. To 
have a strong competitive position in the market, the managers should carefully consider 
these mentioned factors and also should dig out other important factors that make the 
customer loyal to particular company that ultimately lead to profitability and growth.
