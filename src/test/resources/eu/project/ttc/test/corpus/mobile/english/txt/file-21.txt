Abstract- Technology is booming in every area around us, whether it is in the field of 
business trade, computer, telecom or any other area. In education system lot of trends and 
competitions are emerging for the career and betterment of the students. Now a days many 
types of value added services (VAS) and various response systems and public response 
systems are available and running successfully around us. These value added services 
always adds remarkable values to the industry. Likewise here is a solution for the betterment 
of students and the faculties even for the parent and guardian of the students, that they can 
access information in a easier way from every corner of the world. An Interactive response 
system is been developed for fetching information over mobile by means of GPRS services, 
in the form of SMS, relevant information regarding students Exams registration, attendance, 
their daily activities in the college, on the cost of mere negligible charges. These interactive 
response systems will definitely going to be an asset for the institution and its students and 
faculties. This software deals with the SMS based applications. In this software an interactive 
database management system has been implemented by which the parent and guardian can 
get student's information using SMS service. As every mobile is having the capability of to an 
from SMSing,this makes the beauty part of this software as every mobile subscriber can 
benefit from this facility & thus saves precious time .At the same time this a very cost effective 
way to know about the current information of students. Finally, it may be emphasized that this 
system is public friendly & easy to use.
