Convergence environments and technologies are urgently coming close to our life with various wireless communications and
smart devices in order to provide many benefits such as connectivity, usability, mobility, portability, and flexibility as well as lower
installation and maintenance costs. Convergence has brought important change not only in the way we live but also in the way
we think. It is the progress towards the attempt to create and to evolve new valuable services through the device convergence
and fusion of in-home, office, and various environments around the personal mobile apparatus. Based on the dynamic trends of
convergence, it is widely argued that the increased requirements on secure and robust connectivity between a variety of mobile
devices and their applications provide us the era of real pervasive computing environment. Thus, in this paper, we present a
novel connectivity architecture using RF4CE-(Radio Frequency for Consumer Electronics-) based wireless zero-configuration and
enhanced key agreement approach. We analyze the security and performance of our proposed approach by the development of the
prototype H/W and the construction of a testbed with CE and mobile devices.
