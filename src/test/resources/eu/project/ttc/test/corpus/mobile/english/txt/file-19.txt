The main evaluation was carried out with two similar tools 
based on the E-Model, defined below. Firstly, with a NSN 
proprietary tool, which is an implementation similar to the one 
described in [10][4], and secondly, with IxChariot, which is a 
widely used voice evaluation tool [12]. Finally, a third tool

An obvious limitation of our study is the fact that due to the 
nature of a live network, we are not able to know or control 
the other user traffic that could be taking place at the same 
time. Therefore, we are not able to pinpoint the sources of e.g. 
a sudden quality drop or reduced bitrate. However, since we 
carried out multiple tests, our study provides a realistic view 
of what is the actual performance that could potentially be 
achieved in the field. The measurements for the live network 
study took place during July and August 2007. 
 
III. VOIP QUALITY ANALYSIS AND RESULTS Figure 2. VoIP Performance Evaluation with Proprietary Tool 
A. HSDPA/WCDMA VoIP Performance 
The tests to evaluate VoIP quality involved the following 
variables: signal conditions, wireless access, and fading 
profiles. Signal conditions were modeled to provide different 
Ec/N0 levels by using attenuators. However, the results in this 
paper show that this variable does not make any sustainable 
difference and therefore, average result values are given 
instead. The wireless access technologies used were restricted 
to HSDPA/128, WCDMA 128/128 and WCDMA 64/64. 
There was no reason to use higher bitrates in this study since  Figure 3. VoIP Performance Evaluation with IxChariot

B. VoIP Performance with Simultaneous FTP Background 
Traffic 
We also conducted some experiments where we added 
background traffic. The tests included a small number of 
simultaneous users running FTP downloads in order to 
evaluate if they had any effect on the VoIP performance.  Figure 6. Packet Loss Percentage 
The results show an increased jitter and packet loss for 
WCDMA 128/128 and 64/64. Further delay analysis shows 
that this increase is most likely caused by constant RLC 
retransmissions. RLC retransmissions have an effect on both 
jitter and packet loss. Every time a RLC retransmission takes 
place, it will cause a ~200ms delay peak. This peak can 
potentially fill the jitter buffer causing an overflow, which 
results in packet loss. Packet loss also affects voice quality. 
The frequency of RLC retransmissions is dependent of the 
 access in use. Figure 9 shows an example of the RLC 
Figure 4. Effect of Background Traffic retransmissions (200ms delay peaks) for different wireless 
 access technologies. 
As we expected, a limited number of users cannot affect 
VoIP quality (see Figure 6). The reason is tied to the Round 
Robin Scheduling used in the system, which divides 
bandwidth equally among users. With only 4 simultaneous 
users, each user will be given enough bandwidth on a timely 
basis (every few milliseconds). In order to measure the effect 
of background traffic we encourage tests with a much larger 
number of users, e.g. 15-20 would be required. This is out of 
the scope of this document. Likewise, testing different 
scheduling techniques such as Weighted Proportional Fair is 
of interest. However, there are several simulation based 
studies [15][2] that study VoIP capacity gains for different  Figure 7. RLC Retransmissions

transmission (e.g. decoding failure), a retransmission will take 
place directly from the BTS without requiring any action from 
the RNC. This is a powerful advantage since the 
retransmissions are combined at the terminal. However, if 
there is a physical layer failure, such as a signaling error, then 
an RLC retransmission is required, and packets are 
retransmitted from the RNC (see Figure 10). This obviously 
results in an increase in delay, which is not beneficial for 
services like VoIP. While RLC retransmissions are not a very 
 frequent event in HSDPA in static scenarios, they are more

summarizes the jitter average and packet loss encountered 
when using the G.711 codec. End-to-End delay is the main reason for low voice quality. 
With the total end-to-end total delay average values we can 
extend the analysis by dividing the sources of delay (see Table

extensive and mostly based on simulations. For instance, some 
papers [18][19][5] study VoIP performance in WCDMA and 
provide some baseline results. In addition, other works 
[11][22] provide some estimated values for processing delays. 
In these studies, the assumption for the estimations is based on 
whether the call is towards a landline or a mobile end. Some

assumes around 75ms. These delay values include the jitter

are too optimistic, especially when compared to our

unacknowledged mode, potentially use smaller jitter buffer

High quality VoIP in 3G networks will be possible. However, 
it is tied to improvements in several areas such as wireless 
network delay, client implementation, and client processing 
delay. 
Finally, a main improvement developed while this 
manuscript was in process is CS over HSPA, which improves 
capacity and thus, can allow operators to delay VoIP 
deployment projects until networks and terminals have better 
performance.
