In this paper, for the purpose of interfacing with the real support SMS inside the devices and can work with the 
time control applications, the PC parallel port is used. network that provide the services of SMS. 
Since the parallel port works well as hardware interfacing  
[7]. The following figure depicts the proposed system that 
  controlled remote PC.  
The parallel port pins are TTL levels output (originally 
derived by a 74LS374 octal latch). This means that they 
put output 0 to 0.8 dc volt logically 0, and 2.4 to 5 dc volt 
logically 1. According to the parallel port behaviors, there 
are 8 bits for data input/output, which can produce 256 
different control signal statuses [8].  
 
The data bit signals can be managed by software that 
applied for this purpose, the powerful software language 
is C++ which can access the ports more efficiently than 
other available computer program languages. As the Figure1. PC remote control system

There are many ways could be used to control all home's 
appliances by sending appropriate signals to the PC's 
ports, parallel or serial. Then these signals inserted to the 
interface hardware system that prepared, designed and 
matches with the output signals, then depend on the 
signal, the interface hardware control or manage one or 
more of the home appliances. 
 
The designed program will make the PC parallel port to 
send signals which appear as approximately 5 volts at one 
or more bits of eight data bits on the parallel port. These 
volts will change the status of the interface hardware [9]. 
In order to do that, there are many electronic circuits 
which can be useful for this purpose, or one could build 
its own electronic circuits. In most cases the general
