 PAGE   2 Limits to Growth of Multinational Replicator Companies The Case of Mobile-Phone Operators Svein Ulset Norwegian School of Economics & Business Administration Breiviksveien 40, 5045 Bergen, Norway Svein.Ulset@nhh.no tel: (+47) 91184343 March, 2009 Abstract The notion of a resource-based competitive advantage contains a paradox. How can superior and inimitable resources that are so widely believed to be the source of competitive advantage also be a source of competitive advantage for multinational companies that compete by replicating their highly standardized and increasingly imitable business models in foreign markets? This article examines the competitive advantage of multinational replicator companies through the combined lens of the resource-based view and transaction cost economics. I ask what it is that distinguishes business model transactions (replications) after which I compare the efficacy of multinational and national firms for managing such transactions (replications). I conclude that there is a source of sustainable competitive advantage for multinational replicators, that such an advantage is more likely to be found in the multinationals' dynamic capabilities than in their locally operative business models, but also that such capabilities and business models may contain the seeds of their own demise partly caused by the replication strategy itself, partly by attributes of the business model such as open and non-proprietary global standards and weak appropriability regimes. Key words:  Construct Development and Evaluation; Transaction Cost Economics; Knowledge Transfer INTRODUCTION According to Winter and Szulanski (2001), replication entails the creation and operation of a large number of similar outlets that deliver a product or perform a local service, sometimes referred to as the "McDonald's approach". Such outlets are generally designed and operated according to the parent's standard recipe for successful local business operations. Such recipes or business models cannot, however, be made replicable (readable) to affiliated firms without also being made increasingly imitable to rival firms.  In particular, how can multinational replicators that compete by replicating their increasingly imitable business models in foreign markets possibly sustain their competitive advantage over national rivals? To examine this imit ability paradox we choose a combination of the resource based view (RBV) and transaction cost economics (TCE), while focusing on one particular replication industry, the international mobile communications industry. Whereas RBV specifies what business model attributes may lead to sustainable competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993), TCE indicates what governance safeguards might be needed when most profitable utilization of such business models requires widespread replications in foreign markets (Williamson, 1981; Teece, 1980, 1986b). According to RBV, superior (valuable and rare) business models can only represent a sustainable competitive advantage to the extent they are effectively protected against imitation (leakage) either by legal protection (by patent law) , contractual protection (by incentives and control mechanisms), strategic protection (by local monopoly positions) or natural protection (by barriers to imitation). However, natural barriers to imitation by rival firms are also potential barriers to replication by affiliated firms. In particular, natural barriers such as unique historical conditions , causal ambiguity and social complexity prevent not only unfavorable imitation by rival firms, but also favorable replication by the company's own dispersed operations.  Thus, to improve replication, firm resources such as branded business models may first need to be made l ess history dependent (i.e.; by creating substitute resources), less casual ambiguous (i.e.; by clarifying causal relations), and less socially complex (i.e.; by simplifying social structures).  These kind of improved replicability generally means enhanced imitability and thus waning profitability. Successful replicators are therefore destined for a serious imitability dilemma to the extent remaining imitation protections are also weak. Although several scholars have recognized the above imitability paradox (Winter, 1987; Szulanski, 1996; Knott, 2003; Maritan and Brush, 2003), few have so far critically examined its ultimate ramification that in certain industries superior and costly-to-imitate (sticky) resources cannot be the most important source of sustainable competitive advantage. Similar boundary conditions have been discussed by Barney (1997: 171), Eisenhardt and Martin (2000) and D'Aveni (1994) in relation to high-velocity industries and supercompetition markets. Under such dynamic conditions, barriers to imitation do not only protect against technology leakage, but also against dynamic competition and its favorable effects on efficiency and innovations. After all, what we normally associate with protracted isolation from competition is not high, but low performance. Here, we extend this enquiry to include multinational replicator companies in fairly dynamic markets such as the mobile communication services market. Our multinational replication model will now be further developed in section 2 and summarized into three comprehensive propositions dealing with the structural effects of differential competitive advantage/disadvantage of multinational versus national firms in terms of consolidation/fragmentation of local markets. In section 3, examples from the international mobile industry will be used to illustrate our propositions. Section 4 finalizes the paper with a conclusion and discussion. A TCE STRATEGY MODEL ON KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER Replication Business As stated above, replications entail the creation and operation of a large number of similar outlets that deliver a product or perform a local service.  Such replications consist of knowledge transfer of broad scope covering a large portion of the total knowledge endowment of the recipient outlets. It is managed by a central organization that develops knowledge about valuable traits of the business model that need to be replicated, the method by which such traits are replicated, and the kind of environments where outlets with such traits can successfully operate. Such business model traits consist of valued features of the product or the service that the outlet provides, procedures involved in producing those features, procurement methods that allow the outlet to acquire the various inputs needed to carry out those procedures, and finally marketing approaches that inform customers about the attractive features of their offerings. Foreign outlets are either built from scratch or acquired and then converted into local subsidiaries compatible with the company's standard business model. The various business model traits are interdependent because, for example, what is required in terms of production procedures, procurement methods and marketing campaigns depends on the appealing product features being replicated. Not all business model traits are possible to replicate or worth being replicated. Only a subset with expected positive effects on performance will normally be selected, refined and prepared for replication. Such core traits cannot possibly be available from the outset, but must instead be acquired through experiential learning, preferably with reference to some guiding best practice example (template). While some business model traits are highly standardized and uniformly replicated across all outlets, others are localized (locally customized) to the local conditions of each outlet and never replicated. Together, replicable business models and their central support organization make up most essential parts of a replicator's competitive advantage or " firm resources " as defined by Barney (1991: 101). Replication Organization In our replication governance model, knowledge transactions are intermediate "business-to-business" transactions. They occur when attractive business model traits (individually or bundled) are transferred across technologically separable interfaces (Williamson, 1996:58): one kind of activity ends (e.g.; knowledge supply) and another begins (e.g.; knowledge utilization). Knowledge can be transferred (traded) either in its basic form as a set of principles or in its applied form as a set of applications, bundled into replicable business models.  The transfer process includes both the initial search and selection phase where attractive business model traits are recognized and their potential value revealed, and the subsequent transfer and utilization phase, where model traits are transferred and productively exploited for which an accompanying consulting service may be needed when such traits (business knowledge) cannot be fully articulated. In mobile telecommunications, for example, technical interface standards are the main attribute affecting tradability of upstream services. In particular, open interface standards would allow highly localized downstream firms to contract with the upstream markets for the provision of similar technical solutions and services as provided by the central units of their horizontally integrated multinational company. In line with standard TCE, k nowledge governance modes are assumed to differ with respect to incentive intensities, formal/informal controls and dispute settling mechanisms, here combined into the three generic and coherent structures of firm, hybrid and market (where administrative control, the use of low powered incentives and non-legalistic conflict resolutions bear a supporting and complementary relation to each other in the sense of doing more of one increases the return of doing more of the others). Since the clusters of attributes that define firm, hybrid and market provide contractual safeguards of high, medium and low degrees, these three governance modes are also assumed to be operationally more efficient it situations where contractual hazards are of high (firm), medium (hybrid) and low (market) degrees, respectively. According to TCE, inimitable firm resources are just another form of relationship-specific (non-redeployable) assets. To facilitate replication in foreign markets multinationals may build replication capabilities capable of converting inimitable knowledge into sufficiently redeployable and locally adaptable business models. The more redeployable the business knowledge, the less troublesome the frictions between transferor and transferee, but also the more troublesome the associated leakage hazards. Locally customized (less-replicable) business models may still retain some sustainable competitive advantage in their respective local markets, but globally standardized (highly replicable) business models may decreasingly so. In particular, under conditions highly favourable of global scale economies, such as when standardized transactions create superior conditions for market aggregation economies (Williamson, 1985; 1989), large-scale upstream suppliers and service providers may be advantaged over horizontally integrated multinational operators, causing the latter to be bypassed and replaced by a contracting network of upstream multinational suppliers and downstream national operator customers. Indeed, under conditions of weak legal, contractual or strategic protections, effective replication strategies may even contain the "seeds of their own demise." Conversely, under conditions highly unfavourable of global scale economies, such as when local markets are very dissimilar (unrelated) allowing few global best practices to be shared, local companies are similarly advantaged over horizontally integrated multinational operators. In between these conditions, when local markets share the same conditions and thus the need for  similar, but difficult-to-trade, knowhow (best practices) there is an efficiency space for horizontally integrated multinationals, given that sufficient replication capabilities and imitation safeguards can be provided. Figure 1 illustrates the argument (similar to Williamson (1985: 90-95) and Teece (1986b)). GCF, GCX and GCM are cost schedules representing the average governance costs of fully integrated firms, hybrid forms, and market modes. For simplicity reason, all cost schedules are assigned the general linear form GC=A + bk, where A is administrative investment (central replication capabilities), b is marginal costs and k is level of stickiness (production volume (x) is provisionally assumed to be constant).  The horizontal axis measures the level of stickiness of business knowledge (knowhow). Contractual transfer costs are assumed to increase with such stickiness, but less so for integrated firms than for hybrid forms, and less for hybrids than for market modes (thus, bI< bX< bM). The reason for these inequalities is higher upfront investment in central replication capabilities and equally stronger support for cooperative adaptation in the former integrated firm mode than in the latter hybrid and market modes (thus AI> AX>AM). k1 and k2 are threshold values indicating the level of stickiness at which it is governance cost efficient to change from market to hybrid and from hybrid to integrated firm. ΔGC, ΔLC and ΔPC are governance, leakage and production cost differences, respectively, that arise from changing from a less to a more protective governance mode (e.g.; from franchise to horizontal integration). Whereas a positive cost difference indicates an advantage for the less protective governance mode (franchise), a negative cost difference indicates an advantage for the more protective mode (integration). Which of the least protective modes that will serve as basis for comparison will be indicated in the text, hence no subscript.  On the average, we expect the corporate mode to offer better leakage protection than the hybrid and market modes throughout (ΔLC < 0), but decreasingly so with increasing stickiness. The reason for the latter is the following: Since increasing stickiness makes the knowhow increasingly self-protected, the extra leakage protective ability of integrated firms compared to hybrid and market modes will be less needed as knowhow gets stickier. Thus, as knowhow approaches maximum stickiness, differential leakage cost approaches zero. Note that production costs (PC) in our case include both initial search costs associated with discovering best practice and subsequent replication costs associated with converting sticky knowhow into replicable solutions and transferring and adapting these to local conditions. Let ΔPC be the average production cost difference for a local operating company between acquiring the knowhow from the central service unit of a horizontally integrated multinational enterprise (thus acting as a subsidiary of such an enterprise) and acquiring similar knowhow from an international partner or an outside international service company (acting as a franchisee/licensee and customer/buyer, respectively). Irrespective of procurement (external production) mode, the local operating company will carry out the necessary local adaptation and implementation. On the average, and holding output constant, we expect markets to offer better conditions for low-cost production than internal organization and hybrid arrangements (ΔPC >0). Not only will markets (and particularly large franchises) often be able to aggregate diverse demands from a larger number of buyers (franchisees), thereby to realize economies of scale and scope. Outside service companies that are serving numerous leading corporate customers all over the world will also have better opportunities to discover and transfer industry best practice than any of these customers, even the largest ones, having a lot fewer operating units (subsidiaries) to serve and to learn from. Expressing ΔPC as a function of knowledge stickiness, it is therefore plausible to assume that ΔPC will be positive throughout, but decreasingly so as stickiness increases. That is, the production cost penalty for using internal organization is large for standardized transactions for which market aggregation economies are great, whence ΔPC is larger where k is low. The cost disadvantage decreases but remain positive for intermediate degrees of stickiness. Although discovering best industry practices and converting these into replicable solutions have now become more difficult, outside suppliers are still able to aggregate the diverse demands of many buyers and produce at lower cost than can a firm that only produces to its own needs. As leading best practice becomes very sticky, however, there is almost no useful knowledge to extract and transmit, and aggregation economies of outside supply can no longer be realized, whence ΔPC asymptotically approaches zero. Production costs are, however, not only affected by knowledge attributes such as stickiness, but also by local conditions to which knowledge needs to be customized. Operating in increasingly dissimilar markets creates increasing production/replication costs, partly due to the demand for increasing local customization, partly due to fewer global solutions to share and thereby less global scale and scope economies to benefit from. Expanding into highly dissimilar markets therefore causes ΔPC to shift upwards and the integration threshold to move rightwards forcing multinationals to focus on more sticky business models (given these are competitively advantageous). [Figure 1. Comparative Governance, Leakage Costs and Production Costs, about here] However, to further enhance profitable growth in foreign markets, multinationals may need to make their business model less costly and more replicable, essentially by making them less sticky (not more sticky, as above). Assuming for the moment that ΔPC=0, this may imply locating the new business model to the left of k2 where differential governance costs (ΔGC) are positive and horizontally integrated multinational no longer the most cost efficient alternative. Then, to justify the use of a more costly firm organization, some kind of compensating firm advantage will be required such as safer protections against knowledge leakage (imitation). Such protections may include more complete information disclosure, more unifying incentives and a stronger sense of loyalty supported by integrated firms than by hybrid and market organizations. The differential leakage cost schedule (ΔLC), which is assumed to be negative and asymptotically declining with increasing stickiness, indicates such an advantage. The crossover value of stickiness (k) for which the sum of governance cost and leakage cost differences (ΔGC + ΔLC) turns negative now occurs at k3 which is significantly lower than k2 (given ΔPC=0). Leakage-protective firm governance thus favour horizontal integration over greater range of stickiness than would be observed without such leakage protective measures. In particular, the larger the difference in effective leakage protection between alternative governance forms and the higher the associated leakage costs in terms of revenue loss, the larger the negative leakage cost difference (ΔLC) and the stronger the inclination among replicators to stay integrated as their business models becomes more imitable (i.e.; causing the integration threshold (k3) to move further to the left). Conversely, the smaller the difference in effective leakage protection and the lower the potential leakage costs (revenue loss), the smaller the leakage cost differences between integration and hybrid/market contracting and the stronger the tendency among replicators to change into hybrid and even market contracting as their business models become increasingly less sticky and more imitable (in order to grow faster). In the latter case, multinational replicators such as Vodafone would contract with foreign operators for the development and provision of mobile services using the latter's domestic network, often under dual brand. Alternatively, the latter operators may contract with upstream technology suppliers and professional service firms for the provision of similar inputs as provided by their foreign business partner. As these international markets and networks continue to develop, and as their efficiency continue to improve relative to multinational horizontal integration, the competitive advantage of national versus multinational operators will improve correspondingly. To sustain their competitive advantage over increasingly more competitive national rivals, therefore, multinational mobile replicators such as Vodafone and Telenor need to develop some kind of compensating firm advantage, either (a) some kind of superior leakage protective mechanisms (causing GCI to rotate downwards and integration threshold to move further to the  left on the stickiness axis to include more tradable business models) or (b) some kind of additional central replication capabilities and/or local adaptation strategies that are more difficult to imitate than their standard replicable business models (causing ΔPC to shift downwards and the integration threshold to move further to the left). Intellectual property law is one such (external) protection mechanism that may improve replication without causing undue imitation. For example, patents make technological inventions both highly replicable and highly inimitable by making replications of such inventions illegal to all would-be imitators except the licensee. Similar effects may apply to brand names. When protected from imitation by intellectual property laws, a strong brand name "enhances returns because it helps customers to translate favorable experience at one outlet into an expectation of a similar experience at others" (Winter and Szulanski, 2001: 740). On the other hand, when intellectual property rights (e.g.; copyrights, trademarks, patents and related rights) are ineffective, licensing of technology and brand name would be equally ineffective, and should therefore be supplemented with additional contractual safeguards, or entirely replaced by more protective firm-like governance (Teece,1986a). As intellectual property rights are strengthened, the competitive advantage of multinationals over national firms will decline and firm-like governance may again change into franchising/licensing and market contracting. Replication Strategy Our more comprehensive replication strategy model is described in Figure 2. Drawing heavily on the discriminating alignment thesis of TCE, this model examines the performance effects of aligning (a) bundles of knowledge transactions (business models transactions) which differ in their superiority (value and rareness ) and stickiness (inimitability) attributes with (b) knowledge g overnance structures which differ in their costs and replication capabilities , conditioned by local industrial and institutional conditions (extensions from standard TCE in italics ).  Essentially, replication is facilitated by converting sticky (tacit) into replicable (explicit) business models, but since replicable models are also potentially imitable, such replication will not be competitively sustainable unless supported by some compensated firm advantages (as indicated above). [Figure 2. Replication Strategy Model, about here] Gradually, recurrent knowledge transactions will result in a set of business model traits that affect performance through their cost-reducing standardization and value-creating customization attributes. This set of performance-generating attributes defines the company's replication strategy. Such a strategy is determined partly by the way replicators choose to exploit their competitive advantage through their cost economizing discriminating alignment logic (where knowledge transactions are aligned with supportive governance structures), partly by the way replicators choose to exploit or adapt to local industrial and institutional conditions, and partly by the way the latter industrial and institutional conditions affect the former cost economizing knowledge governance alignments. For example, the performance (cost economizing) effects of aligning knowledge processing capabilities with specific governance structures such as horizontally integrated multinationals may depend on institutional conditions such as intellectual property rights (Williamson, 1991). In particular, general improvement in the way such property rights are defined and locally enforced are expected to increase the use of international market and hybrid contracting relative to integrated multinational firms by reducing the transaction costs of the formers relative to the latter. As compensation for insufficient intellectual property rights protections, multinational replicators may develop more efficient central replication capabilities (Winter and Szulanski, 2001) along with more effective local adaptation strategies (Ghemawat, 2007). Such capabilities and strategies may not only compensate for inefficient imitation protection, but also for increasing replication costs associated with increasing cross-country distances - both geographic and non-geographic.  In particular, as home-host country distance increases along c ultural, a dministrative, g eographic and e conomic (CAGE) dimensions, local adaptation costs ( liability of foreignness ) increase correspondingly, along with the need for cost-mitigating local adaptation strategies. Normally, increasing local customization can only be achieved at increasing production costs (due to increasing local adaptation costs and decreasing global scale economies). However, by implementing suitable adaptation levers that either reduce the need, the burden, or the cost of local customization or that improve the effectiveness of such customization, local adaptation can be significantly improved and extended (Ghemawat, 2007).  The effectiveness of such adaptation levers is limited by the size of CAGE distances and the sensitivity of the business to such distances. Beyond certain distance/sensitivity limits, even the most effective levers cannot prevent marginal cost of local customization from exceeding its marginal benefit, causing the efficiency of company units to decline relative to franchise units and indigenous firms, and the competitive advantage of the latter to improve relative to the former. Moreover, since adaptation levers and CAGE distances represent  differential production/replication cost advantages and disadvantages of integration, respectively, and since differential production/replication costs are assumed to vary with degree of stickiness, such levers and distances may also affect the integration threshold (k2 in Figure 1). Whereas effective adaptation levers shift the differential production/replication cost curve (ΔPC) downward and the integration threshold (k2) leftward, thus expanding the range of stickiness value for which integration is the least-cost alternative, effective CAGE distances shift the differential production/replication cost curve upward and the integration threshold rightward, thus restricting the range of stickiness value for which integration is the least-cost alternative (causing indigenous firms and franchised units to replace company units). When successfully applied , business models are not only efficiently transferred , but also productively utilized . Successful application may cause increasing consumer surplus and growing market shares to the extent such models (business knowledge) represents a sustainable competitive advantage. Consolidation occurs when independent local firms are acquired and successfully turned into profitable subsidiaries of a few giant MNCs. Fragmentation indicates the reverse process and occurs primarily when attractive business models disintegrate into two parts, one set of globally applicable upstream products most efficiently developed and provided by upstream multinational suppliers, and one set of locally customized downstream practices more effectively developed by local independent firms than by "captive" subsidiaries of horizontally integrated multinationals. Propositions In short, the consolidation thesis derived from our replication strategy model can be expressed as follows: To the extent attractive business model features are the superior and sticky (costly-to-trade) assets that generate huge scale economies when successfully replicated in an increasing number of similar local markets, global scale economies will also benefit local subsidiaries and contribute to increasing growth and consolidation until such markets are dominated by the subsidiaries of a few giant horizontally integrated multinational enterprises.  Such growth in similar markets depends on a number of strategic factors, one of which is the choice of governance structure for continuous development and exploitation of the company's knowledge-based competitive advantage. Dependent on where such sources of superior knowledge are located, knowledge governance can take the form of a centralized autocratic hierarchy (of the Vodafone type), or a more decentralized democratic hierarchy (of the Telenor type, outlined below) where knowledge assets are more equally shared between local and central levels.  Whereas responding to local tastes, traditions, regulations and other uniquely local conditions are the main responsibility of local operating companies, global learning and replication are the main responsibility of the central support organization. Most typically, global learning takes place in some central organization and constitutes as such the replicator's most important "dynamic capabilities". These are the partly routinized activities carried out to expand or change the capabilities that directly affect revenue generation (sales of the local outlets). Then, under more specialized knowledge governance structures, more sophisticated knowledge processing and replication capabilities can also be developed.  Supported by more sophisticated governance and knowledge processing capabilities, superior and sticky knowledge can be converted and bundled into globally replicable business models. As a result, diffused knowledge (best practice) can be made more replicable by collecting, integrating and assembling separate pieces of knowledge into more coherent and transferable business models, firm specific knowledge can be made more replicable by converting firm-specific solutions into company-wide standards adopted by most subsidiaries, and tacit and socially embedded knowledge can be made more replicable by transferring the key personnel that possesses the knowledge along with the necessary teaching, training and customer support. Given that replication in foreign markets is restricted to fairly similar (related) markets, the above reasoning can be summarized in the following comprehensive growth and consolidation proposition: Proposition 1: Superior and sticky (costly-to-trade) business knowledge (knowhow) will be more efficiently converted, bundled into business models and replicated by horizontally integrated multinationals than by alternative international market and hybrid organizations, causing the knowledge replication capabilities of such integrated multinationals to grow richer and their beneficial effects on knowledge transfer and utilization to grow stronger, thus gradually reinforcing the competitive advantage of horizontally integrated multinationals vis-à-vis independent national rival firms, causing growing market shares and consolidation of similar local market by local subsidiaries of such multinationals. The above proposition assumes that multinational replicators expand into fairly similar local markets (countries). However, as successful replicators self-confidently continue to expand into c ulturally, a dministratively, g eographically and e conomically more distant markets, the pressure for local adaptation increases correspondingly (Ghamawat, 2007). Whereas global companies represent the most centralized and globally standardized company structure, and multidomestic s the most decentralized and locally customized, transnationals represent the most complex company structure deploying their complex global learning capabilities to pursue the "best of both worlds". Local independent companies, on the other hand, freed from any global replication restriction, tend to be more locally customized than even the most responsive of the multinationals, the multidomestics. Thus, the competitive advantage of multinationals over nationals depends very much on the multinationals' capability to respond to increasing pressure for local adaptation. To examine how such capabilities develop, a more evolutionary TCE approach might be useful. Such an approach alerts us to certain myopic learning biases affecting replicator companies as they evolve from multidomestic companies in the immediate post-acquisition phase to increasingly more global or transnational companies in subsequent phases.  As pointed out by Williamson (1999a: 1104), economic actors may not always have the capacity to look ahead and recognize contractual hazards and investment opportunities. Often, the requisite recognition will come as product of experience that often tends to be rather confusing (Levinthal and March, 1993). To minimize confusion and facilitate learning, organizations tend to simplify and to specialize their learning processes. Learning processes get simplified through minimizing interactions and restricting effects to the spatial and temporal neighborhood. They get specialized through focusing attention and narrowing competence. While the above simplification & specialization mechanisms facilitate local learning in the short run, they may also lead to (i) longer-run potential decay of adaptive capability in other domains (ignoring the longer run), (ii) incentives to free-ride on the efforts of others (ignoring the larger picture), and (iii) tendency to overestimate the likelihood of success in other domains (overlooking failure).  Thus, a tradeoff exists between the positive experience of learning facilitation and the negative experience of learning myopia. "Whether positive or negative, the basic proposition is that, once the relevant features affecting such tradeoffs are disclosed the firm will react to such knowledge by taking actions that mitigate future hazards and more fully realize future gain." (Williamson, 1999a: 1104). For example, in the immediate post-acquisition phase, most replicators will be operating as relatively inefficient multidomestic firms, combining high level of local customization with low level of global cost economies. Profitability can then be improved by building more elaborate knowledge governance and processing capabilities for exploiting unrealized global cost and learning economies. Learning myopia may now start to hurt full-fledged global replicators such as Vodafone more severely than emerging transnationals such as Telenor. Whereas "temporal" myopia leads to longer-run potential decay of adaptive capability in other domain, "failure" myopia may cause companies to overestimate the likelihood of success in these domains (Levinthal and March, 1993: 110). That is, insofar as they generalize successful experience from current and nearby markets to more distant markets (by reason of failure myopia) in which they already have experienced decaying adaptive capabilities (by reason of temporal myopia), companies are likely to exaggerate considerably the likelihood of success in these more distant markets. In particular, by ordering a growing number of local subsidiaries to adopt centrally certified standard solutions as part of the company's global strategy, successful exploitation of global scale economies is enforced, but only at the cost of longer-run decay of adaptive capabilities in other market domains. As global standardization continues to increase, local adaptation and innovation will start to decline causing subsequent decline in local revenue. In transnational companies, on the other hand, where knowledge processing is more highly developed, global learning is achieved through a two-step search and transfer process where best company practices are first discovered and selected from a large number of operating units, then explicated and transferred as standard practices to all other relevant local units who will start applying  them after having learned how to use them and how to adjust to local conditions (Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1993; this paper's Telenor case). Besides, in industries where most services need to be locally produced and consumed at the same time, most significant cost savings may no longer result from increased utilization of central corporate resources, but rather from increased utilization of local resources, particularly in the poorest developing countries ("bottom of the pyramid" countries). This may then turn third-world nationals into more cost efficient local companies than the subsidiaries of traditional Western multinationals. In "bottom of the pyramid" countries, innovative local business practice can be developed that is more valuable to local operations in other similar developing markets than to subsidiaries in more highly developed markets. These practices may then be more effectively replicated in similar developing markets by other types of international organizations than traditional Western ("top of the pyramid") multinationals. Thus, without effective myopia corrective mechanisms (e.g.; devil's advocate, dialectic enquiry, and outside view; see Hill and Jones, 2008: 29-31), successful multinationals will continue to expand into more distant markets until difficulties in converting and replicating their sticky knowledge assets exceed their abilities to solve such difficulties after which they will be forced to withdraw and to concentrate on a smaller selection of similar and profitable core markets instead (where local industry conditions are more attractive and local institutions more supportive). Whereas experience based myopic learning explain tendencies towards strategic misalignment and overexpansion, myopia corrective mechanisms explain the absence of such tendencies. The essence of the above discussion can be summarized in the following global learning proposition: Proposition 2 : As multinational replicators continue to expand into more dissimilar (distant)  markets, the growth rate of global replicator companies will gradually start to decline relative to the growth rate of competing transnational, multidomestic and national firms due to stronger learning myopia in global than in transnational, multidomestic, and national firms, eventually forcing global replicators to change their international strategy into a locally more responsive one. One common, effective method of reducing the costs of adapting to increasingly dissimilar markets is using a modular system design (Ghemawat, 2007). Such modular designs allow components with shared interface standards to be mixed and matched into locally customized systems.   When based on open standards (e.g.; the global GSM standard), modular designs may enable external suppliers to provide standardized technical services at lower cost than what central support units of horizontally integrated operators can do. Remaining business model traits can then be more effectively customized to local conditions by national operators than by horizontally integrated multinationals (Sanches and Mahoney, 1996; Christensen, 1997; Christensen et al, 2002). In electronic systems industries such as the computer and telecom industries, open digitized interface standards provide the technical conditions for outsourcing to upstream equipment suppliers and service providers (Spiller and Zelner, 1997).  Not only lower-layer network infrastructure, but also higher-layer network management functions and customer support services are now increasingly being digitized, computerized and carried out by software programs rather than by humans alone. As a consequence, network management and customer supports are increasingly converted into standard software programs supplied by upstream software firms and professionally services companies in competition with the central support units of horizontally integrated multinationals. As a further consequence, the competitive advantage of downstream multinational companies over national companies may decline, and fragmentation rather than consolidation of the respective local markets may result. Besides, information about best operating practice may also leak out to upstream multinational technology suppliers and professional service firms that collaborate closely with a diverse array of foreign operator customers.  After all, major equipment suppliers such as Ericsson and Nokia, or specialized telecom consultancies such as A.T. Kearney (providing benchmarking analysis based on data supplied by the industry itself), will have a much larger and more diverse group of local operating companies to work with and learn from than any of their multinational customers, including giants such as Vodafone.  Such upstream migration (leakage) of learning occurs naturally as a result of suppliers' participation in a number of customer related activities such as (i) providing large quantities of after-sales services, (ii) developing best operating procedures based on most recent customer feedback, (iii) participating in joint R&D projects with leading customers, and (iv) recruiting key service personnel from local customers' own service departments. Then, after having converted best operating practices into best industry standards, multinational consulting firms such as A.T. Kearney will be able to transfer these standards to their local customers just as expeditiously as multinational replicators transfer their firm standard solutions to their local subsidiaries. In this way, professional service firms (consultants) may function as the most efficient conveyors of industry best practice. Not only do they develop and provide their own unique solutions. They also benefit from converting best client practice into tradable services and selling these to a larger number of competing clients. Similarly, as multinational network suppliers extend their network outsourcing services ("managed services") also into emerging markets (e.g.; the rapidly growing Indian mobile market), local operators may benefit more from contracting with multinational suppliers and services firms than from integrating with multinational operators, thus causing fragmentation rather than global consolidation also here (Economist, 2006c, 2007b; Figure 3). Indeed, Ericsson, the network equipment supplier that not only produces, but also operates, many of its customers' mobile networks, would rank as the world's third largest mobile-phone operator serving more than 195 million subscribers (Ericsson, 2008). Handset suppliers such as Nokia and Sony Ericsson are also frequently asked by leading mobile operators to develop service applications according to the operator's own specifications. After a short transitional period where the operators are granted exclusive user rights, innovative service applications can also be sold to competing customers. Furthermore, as owner of the enabling technology, upstream integrated technology & services providers may also be more engaged than their downstream operator customers in developing leakage-protecti ve measures, and equally more proficient at exploiting them. Such leakage-protective measures may include (i) concealing the enabling knowledge and selling only its derived applications and services (like professional service firms do), (ii) designing economic, social and technical mechanisms that protect against technology leakage by making leakage less beneficial, less acceptable and less convenient (like many high-tech firms do; see Liebeskind, 1996), and, last but not least, (iii) acquiring intellectual property rights that protect the enabling technologies and their most important applications by making copying illegal and licensing profitable (Teece, 2000).  Gradually, then, as suppliers and their local operator customers learn more about the greater tradability of technology services and advantages of outsourcing, local operators may feel compelled to unbundle additional elements of their business models and outsource also these to upstream technology suppliers, similar to what we find in other industries (Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991; Langlois and Robertson, 1995, Langlois, 2004). More recently, pro-competitive interface regulations have produced similar results in the fixed telecom services industry (Ulset, 2007, 2008). Also multinational mobile operators may start to realize what mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) recognized long before them, that there is a lot more to benefit from outsourcing network operations, collaborating with local companies and sourcing innovative ideas from rival and related firms than what most incumbents used to think (Ulset, 2002; Blycroft, 2007).  Such outsourcing would allow upstream companies to excel in exploiting global cost economies and the downstream companies to excel in adapting services to local needs and conditions. Much of the above can thus be summarized paraphrasing Christensen's (1997) "innovator's dilemma" proposition: After the progress in mobile phone technology vastly overshot the functionality that most customers in emerging low-income markets could utilize, operators that want to win those customers over-served with functionality need to start to compete on cost, convenience, customization, and speed to market, rather than on functionality. To achieve this, modular business systems that allow more productive mixing and matching of globally standardized components and locally customized business practices, tend to be created by national companies rather than by multinational companies. Competitive advantage may then start to migrate from global operators such as Vodafone towards local operators such as Bharti (see further illustrations below). The following fragmentation proposition summarizes the above discussion: Proposition 3 : As business models based on open interface standards are gradually converted into standardized elements (traits) to maximize global cost economies, such business model elements (traits) tend to develop into separately tradable products, more efficiently developed and produced by upstream technology suppliers and professional service firms and transferred to downstream operators using international market and hybrid contracting rather than horizontally integrated multinational enterprises, thus causing gradual fragmentation of local downstream markets. The international mobile communications industry will now be used to further illustrate the workings of our replication strategy model. THE MOBILE COMMUNICATION SERVICES INDUSTRY Introduction At the beginning of the millennium, European incumbent mobile operators considered expansion into foreign markets as their most profitable business strategy. Until then, international roaming agreements had sufficed as mode of coordination of international traffic between national operators. To justify their creation and sizeable investments, therefore, horizontally integrated multinational operators needed to provide extra valuable support services such as exclusive distribution of leading technology and industry best practices to their local affiliates, besides privileged access to other superior corporate assets including the purchasing power of particularly large global operators.  To the degree such benefits are significant, global consolidation may result. To the degree they are less significant, or to the degree similar services can be provided using simpler contractual modes, fragmentation may result. [Figure 3. Consolidation, about here] In the figure above, we have classified Vodafone and Telenor as global and transnational respectively. Since Vodafone, until quite recently, appeared to be much more occupied with rebranding acquired companies and implement globally standardized services than Telenor, and since Telenor appeared to be much more concerned with building global learning capabilities than Vodafone, we classify, in accordance with Bartlett and Ghoshal (1993, 2000), Vodafone as a global strategy company and Telenor as an emerging transnational company. So far, however, the level of global scale economies achieved by global companies such as Vodafone and transnationals such as Telenor, has not caused radical consolidation of local markets, and may not do so in the nearest future.   Not only will there be significant additional costs associated with organizing multinational wireless giants, but some of the above global scale and scope economic advantages may also turn out to be smaller than originally envisioned, whereas others can be achieved at lower transaction costs through simpler contractual arrangements (as discussed above). Giant global operators such as Vodafone may therefore end up offering their foreign subsidiaries little more than what national operators such as Radiolinja of Finland can provide on their own or through contracting and partnering with upstream suppliers, related and rival firms (including Vodafone itself). Lacking any unique and significant source of competitive advantage, multinational mobile giants may gradually be forced to divest or withdraw from less attractive markets. In the more advanced mobile markets, subsidiaries of multinationals may even end up being divested and reorganized into separate firms that organize their international traffic through interconnection and roaming agreements, rather than though multinational corporations. If so, fragmentation, not consolidation, will result (see Figure 4). [Figure 4. Fragmentation, about here] Entry-friendly regulation reinforces the above fragmentation tendency. To promote competition and prevent abuse of market power, regulatory authorities may order dominant operators to rent out their monopolized assets to downstream service providers at favorable cost-based prices, thus causing fragmentation rather than consolidation in the downstream retail market. Such downstream markets are also less likely to consolidate to the extent the enabling technology is a public good and therefore equally accessible to all potential players or to the extent such technology (applications) is owned by upstream suppliers rather than by vertically integrated multinationals (as often is the case in the mobile industry). As the industry matures and competitive entry-friendly regulation is enforced, not only will the use of contractual governance increase, but also fragmentation rather than consolidation may result. Further illustrations Now, to illustrate in somewhat greater details the knowledge governance and processing part of the above consolidation proposition, Proposition 1 , consider the following development at Telenor. mHorizon. - At the beginning of the post-acquisition consolidation phase, Telenor established mHorizon to deal with international knowledge transfer. The unit was organized as a matrix, consisting of five company value teams (CVT) supervising five groups of partly owned subsidiaries and four skill teams with the responsibility of acquiring, developing, formalizing, transferring and implementing leading technology and best practices. Selected technology and know-how were partly transferred through formalized tools, models and programs, partly by providing own experts to assist in diagnostics, problem solving, adaptation and implementation, partly by seconding key administrative and technical personnel for a longer period if needed, especially in the build-up phase or in major turnaround processes, partly by designing an international network of interactive web pages and best practice workshops. By 2001 Telenor had established nine specialized knowledge networks: customer service, customer retention, prepaid, UMTS, contract and procurement, GPRS, sales and distribution, finance, and accounting. These networks connected appointed local experts representing most affiliates. Regular meetings were held. While many innovative solutions and practices were discussed, and a friendly collegial atmosphere developed, lacking formal authority the knowledge networks had to rely on convincing arguments and telling experience rather than authoritative selection and implementation.  Besides, successful local implementation was often obstructed by a variety of unfavorable local conditions. Telenor was normally only one of several owners, and Telenor representatives counted only a handful of consultants and expatriate managers and specialists in each of their foreign affiliates. To achieve successful local utilization, other local managers and specialists also had to contribute in a productive and mutually supportive way. This did not always happen not only due to insufficient local knowledge, but also due to insufficient global integration. In minority-owned subsidiaries, Telenor most often had to leave the positions as chief executive officer and president to other shareholders. While some owners represented businesses that were neutral or complementary to Telenor Mobile, others represented competing international or local operators. In Russia, for example, Telenor and its partly owned Russian subsidiary VimpelCom formed a strategic partnership with Eco Telecom (part of the Alfa Group of companies in Russia) to accelerate the planned regional expansion of VimpelCom's mobile operation in Russia.  As it turned out, however, conflicting interests and opportunistic behavior, along with numerous lawsuits launched by their Russian partner, precluded further productive relations from developing. Since then, majority ownership has by Telenor been considered a prerequisite not only for efficient knowledge transfer, but also for efficient control over foreign direct investments, particularly in transition economies. As a consequence of insufficient  local representation, competence and cooperativeness, recommended solutions were often ignored, sabotaged or never implemented as intended. The number of active knowledge networks thus declined steadily over the coming years until mHorizon was finally dissolved in 2003 to be replaced by a more powerful and centrally governed global coordination system. Global Systems Approach. - Gradually, Telenor intensified its pursuit for dominant ownership and shareholder agreements that would secure them strategic control over local operations. In areas where the economic benefit of scale economies was most important, such as procurement, Telenor could no longer allow voluntary local compliance. These were also the areas where best practices were most codifiable, and local managers most clearly recognized their own economic benefit from actively supporting a more centralized and explicitly standardized approach. As a consequence, global procurement became the most visible success of the many global coordination efforts. In other areas, however, where criteria for best technical solutions and operating practices were less obvious, initial development could to some extent be hindered by a lack of willingness to share whereas subsequent transfer and implementation were often obstructed by a "not-invented-here" attitude. In one particular instance concerning the choice of service technology, for example, Telenor tried to replicate their centrally authorized choice of technology. Being less convinced about the virtue of the selected technology, however, many local managers consistently postponed their decision to implement. Their reluctance to implement was later justified as the recommended technology proved to be immature and the timing for standardization was wrong, thus demonstrating the classical early adoption dilemma in regimes of rapid technological change. Gradually top management of Telenor realized that the central staff units had grown too large and ignorant of local operational conditions and challenges. Global Coordination Approach. - Being a majority owner is, however, no more than a precondition for effective knowledge transfer. Without highly motivated local managers that want to share, and amenable managers that feel obliged to implement, best solutions and practices cannot be successfully transferred and utilized. In 2004 Telenor therefore started to develop its so-called Global Coordination approach, consisting of two distinct elements. On the one hand there is a bottom-up democratic best practice selection process. On the other hand there is a hierarchy that corrects, approves, executes and monitors best practice outcomes of this process. To take the first element, this comprises five global teams - Global Infrastructure, Global Procurement, Global Services, Global Consumer Segment, and Global Business Segment - comprising two representatives from each of the subsidiaries plus representatives from corporate headquarters, and covering most fields of shared global interests such as human resource management, procurement, best practice, service concepts, market segmentation, and physical infrastructure. Global teams are charged with identifying a knowledge-transfer project which they believe will improve global performance. It works in the following way. As representatives for their local subsidiaries, global team member are invited to select their most successful and widely applicable best practices and present these at global team meetings that the chief marketing officers (CMO) and chief technology officers (CTO ) from all main subsidiaries attend. After having presented and carefully discussed and scrutinized among themselves each and every proposal, global team members prioritize among the proposals on the basis of the value-creating potential they believe these proposals would represent for their particular subsidiaries. Final aggregate subsidiary priority is achieved by summarizing the representatives' individual priorities. This process is competitive, lively and involving. Each global team will often be debating among as many as forty alternatives before the priority vote is cast and the leaders of the projects emerge. Thereafter the second element of Telenor's knowledge sharing strategy is triggered. The team's collective decision has to be presented and defended at a meeting of the Telenor's Mobile Management Board (MMB) consisting of chief executive officers of the subsidiaries and members of Telenor's General Executive Management (GEM) with Telenor CEO, Fredrik Baksaas, acting as MMB chairman. MMB approval is usually forthcoming, but the board's main role is to determine evaluation criteria for the project and to approve a time-table. There is to be no hiding-place for any of the members of the global project team. They will be judged by the MMB collectively. Responsibility for development of final solutions is delegated to local operating companies with leading expertise in the respective fields. Local subsidiaries are expected to implement centrally approved best practices, unless exempted due to special local conditions. The active presence of CEO Fredrik Baksaas at MMB meetings assures maximum corporate backing and the avoidance of costly appeals of disputable decisions to higher corporate levels. With the MMB approved decision in place the project leader sets about implementing the project. After having actively participated in the decision making process and having pledged to act in accordance with the MMB's final decision, local mangers are committed and motivated to assisting the project leader in her task. Apparently, Telenor's "democratic hierarchy" is succeeding in breaching "not-invented-here" mentalities and in bridging cultural and geographic distances. Telenor's democratic hierarchy for knowledge transfer thus resembles an internal knowledge services market where subsidiaries first present, discuss and select their favorite candidate solutions, then continue to develop and implement centrally approved final solutions. Judged by its impressive subscriber growth and dominant market position in many foreign markets, as well as by its rather successful development of knowledge governance structures from the early less integrated mHorizon to the later more fully integrated Global Coordination, Telenor may have achieved the kind of productive mix of global scale economies  and local responsiveness suggested by our knowledge governance model. At the same time, Telenor has continuously been reducing the numbers of globally exploitable knowledge fields (synergy areas) in response to the growing maturity of the industry, which lately have been showing increasing use of market and hybrid contracting also in connection with knowledge transfer and utilization. Now, to illustrate the global learning proposition, Proposition 2 , consider the expansion strategy of a global replicator company such as Vodafone. As Vodafone continued to expand into more distant markets (like the Japanese market), and as the local responsiveness disadvantages of their globally standardized strategy started to exceed its cost advantages, failing performance forced Vodafone to change its globally strategy into a locally more responsive one. Apparently, this made Vodafone redirect growth from advanced markets with already very high penetration and moderate growth expectations (e.g.; Sweden, Japan) to emerging markets with low penetration and high growth expectations (e.g.; India, Sub-Saharan Africa) while simultaneously designing low-cost business models capable of providing the services that low-income customers in emerging market can afford to buy. The most prominent example of this kind of learning trade-offs, and associated hazards mitigation, is the recent divestiture of Vodafone Japan, the previously local independent operator J-Phone. Having failed miserably in introducing their standard third-generation (3G) world phone to the saturated and competitive Japanese market, Vodafone Japan was divested and sold to the Japanese conglomerate Softbank (Economist, 2006b). As compensation for its loss of the Japanese market, Vodafone decided to acquire a larger share of the rapidly growing Indian mobile market, and bought a controlling interest in the 4th largest operator, Hutchison Essar Limited, and a minority interest in the largest national operator, Bharti, known for its innovative business model. A few months later Vodafone bought remaining shares of Essar, and turned it into a local Vodafone subsidiary. In particular, the "super-light" operator Bharti outsources most of its operations to IBM, Ericsson and Nokia and spends nothing on research and development in order to focus on its downstream core skills of marketing and customer management (Economist, 2006c). Local independents like Bharti compete against multinationals by pursuing even higher levels of local responsiveness than what can be pursued by multidomestic firms, but without the attendant cost disadvantage. Here, global scale economies is realized by contracting and collaborating with a diverse range of upstream suppliers, related and rival companies (market mode) instead of acquiring and integrating these into the downstream network operator (corporate mode). To serve emerging low-income markets better, a plethora of specialized low-cost modular devices, programs and services have emerged, capable of causing similar unbundling of the mobile wireless system as open interface standards once did to the minicomputer and similar system products (Langlois and Robertson, 1995; Christensen, 1997; Christensen et al, 2002). To the extent local independents face greater variety of competing solutions and enjoy greater freedom to experiment and innovate than subsidiaries of multinational replicators, learning myopia may even hurt independents like Bharti less than most multinational companies. [Figure 5. Indian mobile-phone operators, about here] Thus, in response to increasing market saturation and industry maturity, also Vodafone now seems increasingly prepared to change its international growth strategy from a globally standardized strategy into a more locally responsive one. After a period of declining financial results and declining share prices (despite growing numbers of subscribers), the company now promotes transfer of replicable elements of their business model not only to their own consolidated local subsidiaries, but also to external network partners and local independent firms while outsourcing other elements to upstream suppliers and service providers. Finally, to illustrate the fragmentation proposition, Proposition 3 , consider recent initiatives suggesting that the advantage that giant operators such as Vodafone might have over national operators and medium sized multinationals such as Telenor tend to be smaller than originally envisioned (Vodafone now being "only" 3 times the size of Telenor in numbers of mobile subscribers). First, Vodafone along with several other operators and suppliers, are voluntarily contributing to international standardization though joint efforts such as "Open Mobile Architecture", thus supplementing the work of industry bodies such as UMTS Forum and GSM Association and official standardization bodies such as 3GPP and ETSI.  As a consequence, technical features that otherwise could have served as basis for differentiation and competition, will gradually vanish. The growing influence from pro-competitive national regulations in terms of unbundling and leasing requirements will furthermore diminish the difference in competitive strength between multinational giants and national network operators (Rehak, 2007). Second, it is increasingly possible for national operators to access private global networks, services and brands through partnership such as "Vodafone Partner Agreement" or though international alliances rather than through subsidiary membership in Vodafone or similar multinational mobile-phone operators.  Recent proposals for the financing and operation of third-generation (3G) wireless networks indicate the same. Essential facilities such as masts, ditches, cables, base stations and even radio frequencies may be jointly owned and operated by two or more operators, but rented out to as many facilities-less operators and service providers as possible to minimize service unit costs. Especially in the more highly developed markets such as in the Scandinavian, UK and US markets (Ulset, 2002, 2008; AT Kearney, 2007a; Blycroft, 2007), network capacity is increasingly being resold and radio access rented out to competing service providers. The latter operators and providers will be competing on the basis of the remaining non-essential facilities, with a special focus on advanced service applications and smart cards inside mobile phones (so-called SIM cards). At the same time, multinational equipment suppliers and professional services firms increasingly perform network construction and upgrading, operation service and maintenance. Increasingly, therefore, basic network operation and capacity wholesale are developing into commodity businesses, separated from downstream retailers that carry out subscription sales, branding, marketing, billing and customer support. These contractual arrangements may contribute to reducing the costs of building and operating the enormously expensive 3G mobile networks significantly (by as much as 40%).  As soon as the first couple of players have managed to achieve this, remaining players cannot but adopt the same contractual practice. Third, it is far from obvious that multinational network operators will emerge as more natural owners of the "mobile" brand than national network operators or portal operators to the Internet. On the contrary, the most popular brand is "Nokia", and the start page of your new mobile phone can be owned and supplied by any Internet portal operator. The greatest potential for differentiation lies probably in the delivery of content services, but the most attractive of these will probably have a local rather than a global flavor. Supernormal profits will consequently be derived more from local responsiveness than from global coordination. Neither do exclusive content distribution agreements appear to be particularly attractive as long as subsidiaries of multinational operators seldom are dominant operators in local markets. Fourth, once declining stocks of Vodafone and other multinational wireless giants may not only reflect stagnant ARPU (average revenue per user) in a preliminary saturated market waiting for the next generation mobile wireless services to catch on. It may also reflect that investors expect future ARPU and stock prices to depend more on equipment makers, content providers and even alternative wireless communications technologies (e.g.; WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) and WiMAX networks) than on mobile wireless operators' own capabilities. Should the former upstream suppliers succeed in protecting their property rights in technology and content to a larger degree than today (similar to Microsoft), they will also succeed in capturing a larger share of future profit of downstream wireless operators. As a consequence, several competing forces emanating from local rivals, new entrants, substitutes and even shareholder activists will continue to prevent multinational wireless giants from dominating local markets (Economist, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a). CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION The foregoing discussion reaches the conclusion, contradictory to mainstream RBV, that superior and inimitable (costly-to-trade) knowledge can hardly be a source of sustainable competitive advantage of multinationals that compete by replicating their business models in foreign markets where legal protection (property rights), contractual protection (private secrecy clauses), strategic protection (monopoly positions), and natural protection (stickiness) are all weak or missing, and where the weakness of natural protection (stickiness) is caused by open and non-proprietary global standards. In these cases, global standards perform the coordination that multinational enterprises otherwise might have performed. Most of the remaining firm specific part of the business model that might have differentiated the focal firm from competition is converted into increasingly imitable, or even tradable, elements as a result of the replication strategy itself. That is, to succeed as multinational replicator, superior and sticky knowledge assets must first be converted into explicit and imitable information and bundled into replicable business models for which a specialized knowledge processing hierarchy will be needed. If not converted, inimitable knowledge isolated from competition is likely to depreciate relatively quickly even in moderately dynamic markets. Under such competitive conditions, local subsidiaries of horizontally integrated multinationals may no longer be clearly advantaged over local independent firms in accessing leading technology and industry best practice, while still being somewhat disadvantaged in responding to variations in local needs, traditions and regulatory conditions. Thus, the competitive advantage that subsidiaries of integrated multinationals once had over national firms may start to erode, probably affecting global companies more severely than transnationals due to larger learning myopia among the former than the latter (since the simplification & specialization mechanisms that most typically characterize learning myopia characterize global companies to a greater extent than transnational companies). If so, vertical fragmentation (increasing disintegration) rather than consolidation (increasing integration) will result. That is, fragmentation (declining local market share) rather than consolidation tends to occur as previously integrated business models evolve into modular systems causing the globally standardized parts of such models to be outsourced to upstream competing suppliers and service providers whereas the locally customized parts are increasingly being exposed to competition from smaller and more innovative rival and related companies. Such modularity will not only enable competing upstream suppliers and service providers to participate in developing more innovative, locally responsive, and even cheaper, business models. It will also produce indirect network externalities under which greater availability of complementary system components (e.g.; applications and services) increases the return to each single system innovation (e.g.; new network technology) thereby increasing the incentives for developing more innovative business models, especially to the extent open interface standards are also non-proprietary (like the GSM standard), thus favoring creative entrants more than protective incumbents. In many replicator industries, therefore, where legal, contractual, strategic and natural protections against imitation are all weak, sustainable competitive advantage may simply not be attainable, as far as replicable business models are concerned. If so, any remaining sources of sustainable competitive advantage must reside elsewhere. One possible candidate would be some kind of central "dynamic capability" whose purpose is not to convert and replicate itself but to search and select appropriate business model elements, to convert and bundle such elements into replicable business models, to reproduce the bundles they chose to replicate, and finally to select appropriate sites (attractive foreign markets) where bundles can be replicated. One such candidate is Telenor's international knowledge transfer organization Global Coordination supervised by its corporate Mobile Management Board. In the parlance of TCE, such a "dynamic capability" would either be conceived of as a specialized governance structure ("democratic hierarchy") closely aligned with the larger multinational governance structure, or as just another firm-specific organizational asset specialized in international knowledge transfer. This paper has discussed two closely related topics that deserve more critical research: the sustainability of competitive advantage and the choice of the most appropriate international organization for exploiting such advantage. First of all, multinational companies in general and replicators in particular seem to be operating much closer to a market solution than recognized by most scholars. This certainly applies to the "classic" case of multinational restaurant chains where company-owned units are combined with franchise units in a mutual beneficial way (Bradach, 1997), but also to multinational mobile network operators. Like McDonalds, also Vodafone, the largest multinational mobile replicator, has more foreign non-equity operations than equity operations (42 vs. 25). Such non-equity operations (partners) cooperate with the mother company Vodafone in the development and marketing of certain services, often under dual brand logos. The internalization part ("I") of Dunning's (1980, 2000) "OLI" paradigm should therefore be modified, at least as far as successful multinational replicators are concerned.  Such replicators are expected to have (a) certain special assets which give them a competitive advantage over indigenous firms (the strategic advantage factor), (b) these assets are more economically utilized in production facilities in parts of the world beyond the firm's domestic markets (the location factor), but, in contrast to the standard OLI paradigm,  (c) the best way to obtain full value from employing the asset in foreign markets is not only to transfer the asset (knowhow) internally within the firm to another affiliated business unit (the transaction cost factor), but also to transfer it externally to selected equity and non-equity (non-affiliated) partners, even to  potential rival firms. The main reason for such an extended use of transfer modes is network externalities. Like restaurant chains, the challenging objective for multinational mobile operators is to maintain sufficient uniformity across affiliated units while achieving sufficient local responsiveness and systemwide adaptation to changing markets at the same time. But, unlike restaurant chains that only benefit from maintaining uniformity across their own company and franchise units, leading multinational mobile operators will benefit from extending such uniformity (compatibility) also to non-affiliated units, and even to potential rival firms, in order to please their travelling customers. Since full global coverage is unattainable for both political and economical reasons, collaborating with competitors is the only solution. Finally, and related to the above, most RBV and TCE research tend to be biased in favor of examining the highly admired and rewarded effects of competitive advantage, integration and consolidation rather than the equally unpopular and unrewarded effects of competitive disadvantage, disintegration and fragmentation (Ulset, 2006). This may occur despite the fact that one type of effects (consolidation) cannot be properly studied without reference to the other opposite effects (fragmentation). What may occur as a result of this bias is, however, that the arguments that explain one type of effects, and that are not simply the inverse of the arguments explaining the opposite effects, will become more highly developed and recognized than the arguments that explain these opposite but equally important effects. Indeed, avoiding the loss of $1 billion from mistaken consolidation when disintegration is the most efficient organizational structure should not be considered as anything less important than winning $1 billion from successful consolidation when integration is the most efficient organizational structure.

Compared with the previous second-generation (2G) network, 3G radio networks offered significantly higher wireless data transmission capacity and enabled the use of powerful mobile phones that would function more like PCs connected to the Internet (transmitting large amounts of data and videos in addition to voice and simple text messages). New 3G licenses were up for bid, but only at highly inflated "Internet" prices. Under mounting threats from new entrants, most incumbents, however, felt they had no choice but to bid and pay whatever the price. The problem was that there appeared to be little demand for the new technology, particularly after the telecom boom went bust. European incumbents burned 150 billion $ for the 3G licences and wrote off plans for network roll-out. Like in many other industries before them, such as the computer, pharmaceuticals, automobile, retailing and steal industries, technological progress had dramatically overshot what mainstream customers could utilize (Christensen, 1997). Companies that now wanted to win the business of customers over-served with functionality had to change the way they competed: they had to design modular upgradeable products and start to compete on speed to market, price, flexibility and convenience, rather than on functionality (Christensen, 2001: 75-76; Christensen et. al.; 2002). Based on a non-proprietary and open architecture, second-generation (2G) networks was not only modular, but also upgradeable to low grade 3G capacity (called 2.5G or 2.75G), allowing a rapidly growing number of innovative and disintegrated suppliers, content providers and facilities-less operators to compete in bringing higher-quality and lower-priced products and services to market more quickly. Figure 5. Indian mobile-phone operators Source: The Economist 2007b The numbers, market values, growth rates and global presence of such outlets vary a lot between companies and industries. For example, the numbers of foreign operations of multinational mobile operators such as Vodafone are much smaller, and their market values much higher, than those of multinational fast food companies such as McDonalds (although Vodafone's numbers of local networks (base stations) are normally much larger than McDonalds' numbers of local hamburger restaurants (production facilities) within the same country). This imitability paradox is different from the imitability paradox of Barney (1997:172):  "The less costly it is for managers in a firm to develop and acquire resources that could generate competitive advantage, the less likely it is that these resources will be a source of sustained competitive advantage." There is, of course, an upper limit to such conversion into imitable and replicable assets at which marginal cost (unfavorable imitation by rival firms) exceeds marginal benefit (favorable replication by affiliated firms). Like in Winters and Szulanski (2001), propositions will be developed below about the conditions under which a replication strategy is more likely to succeed in a competitive setting. In our study, these conditions mainly consist of knowledge transaction hazards that make replications under one governance form (e.g.; corporate mode) more efficient than under another (e.g.; market or hybrid modes) (Foss, 2007). To the extent knowledge transfer and utilization are the main functions of multinational companies, as we assume in this study, knowledge transfer and utilization theories are the main theories of such companies (Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1993). Transaction cost economics is one such theory (Williamson, 1981; Teece, 1986, 2006) along with the closely related internalization approach (Buckley and Casson, 1976; Hennart, 1977, 1982; Rugman, 1981); resource-based, dynamic capability and knowledge-based theories of the firm are others (McEvely et al, 2004). For a collection of papers including either internal or external knowledge flows, see Mankhe and Pedersen (2004). None of these, however, make use of more comprehensive models capable of examining both internal and external knowledge flows. The level of integration varies from the least integrated subsidiaries of multidomestic companies to the most integrated subsidiaries of global and transnational companies. Hybrid organizations (e.g.; franchises) will be even less integrated than the least integrated of the multinational enterprises, the multidomestics. Normally, replicators' innovative business methods will receive only weak property rights protections and can therefore relatively easily be imitated and commercialized by rival firms. Here, remaining imitation barriers tend to be "self-imposed" by the would-be imitators themselves (e.g.; local independents) rather than controlled by the resource holders (e.g.; the franchisor). According to Knott (2003), failure to imitate superior routines in the quick printing industry may not be due to the attribute of the routine, which is mostly publicly known, but to the potential imitators' incompetence (failure to gather public information about best practice) at one extreme and overconfidence (deliberate choice to deviate from best practice) at the other. Knott concludes: "The franchisor solves both the incompetence and overconfidence problems by imbedding best practice in a routine and by enforcing that routine." Such "embedding" and "enforcing" capabilities may be viewed as franchisors' and other replicators' most important dynamic capabilities (see also this paper's Telenor case). Knowledge transactions also differ with respect to frequency of transfer (from occasional to recurrent), level of uncertainty (from low to high technical uncertainty) and level of complexity (from single pieces of knowledge to complex bundles, here called business models). The replication strategy model outlined above can be used to examine transfer and utilization of business models in any industry where local subsidiaries of multinational companies compete with local independent firms. Attractive business models consist of the less tradable superior knowledge assets that may generate substantial scale and scope economies when replicated in an increasing number of foreign markets (e.g.; Vodafone's global business model). Service industries such as fast food (McDonald's), lodging (Hilton Hotels), retailing (e.g.; Wall-Mart) and mobile communications (e.g.; Vodafone, Telenor Mobile) are particularly interesting. All these industries consist in part of multinational companies replicating and upgrading their business models in foreign markets while searching for the most profitable trade-off between global scale, scope and learning economies on the one hand and local responsiveness on the other. Attractive business model traits can be transferred either to wholly owned subsidiaries, to partly owned joint ventures, to franchise operations, or to non-competing local independent firms (associates). Some business model traits can be adapted to local tastes and regulations, while others cannot because they already belong to a global standard such as the global GSM technology standard or to the company's own global product brand. Negative effects of distance have been detected not only in trade, but also in many other forms of international economic interaction such as foreign direct investment (FDI), equity trading, patent citation, and e-commerce transactions (see Ghemawat, 2007: 39). Ghemawat (2007) classifies "levers for adaptation" to cross-country differences into: Variation (responding to local variations), Focus (reducing the need for variation, Externalization (reducing the burden of variation), Design (reducing the cost of variation) and Innovation (improving the effectiveness of variation). For a more detailed discussion of possible disadvantages of multinational competitors versus local ones, see Ghemawat, 2007: 56-58. Such economies are realized as excess capacities in valuable assets are more fully utilized in the production of an increasing number of identical (scale) or related (scope) products at decreasing cost per unit produced. Among potential scale and scope assets, knowledge is assumed to be the most important since knowledge tends to grow with increasing use, contributing not only to static economies, but also to dynamic economies of scale and scope, particularly when disseminated through the global intra-firm learning systems of multinational enterprises. For this to happen, local markets must be similar in terms of their requirements for such scale and scope assets. The more different they are, the less need there will be for shared scale and scope assets and the less need there will be for multinational companies to organize the respective service transactions. In the outmost cases, where critical knowledge is either fully centralized into purely global firms (e.g.; Vodafone case) or fully decentralized into purely multidomestic firms (e.g.; early Telenor phase), little basic knowledge is transferred at all to local operating units. Whereas in purely global firms only standard recipes are transferred while basic knowledge is retained in central units, in purely multidomestic firms both standard recipes and basic knowledge are retained in the local units. Subsequent knowledge-based growth is restricted in both instances: in the global case, by limited demand for highly standardized and locally unresponsive global products, and in the multidomestic case, by limited demand for increasingly locally customized high-cost products With social conditioning as integrated part of the standard TCE setup (Williamson, 1999b), the TCE logic has become more compatible with the capability logic (Kogut and Zander, 1992; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995), although the behavior assumptions are still somewhat different. According to the capability view, social conditioning tends to evolve as initially appointed experts from one subsidiary continue to successfully interact with fellow experts from other subsidiaries, face-to-face, over an extended time period. Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) used the notions of socialization when one version of tacit knowledge is converted into another version, internalization for conversion of explicit into tacit knowledge, externalization for converting tacit into explicit knowledge, and combination for converting one explicit version of knowledge into another explicit version. Although structurally different, all types of MNCs may benefit from applying the same cost economizing M-form design principles (Chandler, 1962; Williamson, 1970, 1981). According to these principles, the larger multinational organization should be divided (i) horizontally into separate quasi-independent units to minimize needless interactions and (ii) vertically into separate strategic and operating levels to benefit from vertical specialization of the respective strategic and operating activities. Then, control and incentive mechanisms should be designed within and between units and levels so as to promote both (i) local (subsidiary) goals and (ii) global (corporate) goals (Williamson, 1981: 1550). Both global and transnational firms can be viewed as deliberate attempts at reorganizing local subsidiaries that initially were allowed to operate as quasi-autonomous units to pursue local goals, into administratively more integrated units to promote global goals of which enterprise-wide knowledge processing and transfer is supposedly the most important. Transnationals represent, however, a rather challenging corporate structure. As pointed out by Gooderham and Ulset (2002), unresolved conflicts between competing subsidiaries may cause transnational matrix companies such as ABB to fail and change into a multi-divisionalized structure. In contrast to its original, static version, evolutionary TCE permits replicator companies to behave less farsighted implying that their decisions sometimes may occur more as a result of myopic experience than farsighted calculation (Williamson, 1999a: 1104). The remaining core arguments are otherwise consonant with standard TCE theses, including the general reasoning that "governance is the means by which order is accomplish in relations in which conflict threatens to upset or undo opportunities to realize mutual gain" (Williamson, 1999b: 312), and that "problems of organizations are not predominantly technological but have their origins in the attributes of transactions on the one hand and of human actors on the other" (Williamson, 1999a: 1100). As expressed by Levinthal and March (1993. 105): "As learners are allowed to settle into domain in which they have competence and develop experience in them, they experience fewer and fewer failures. Insofar as they generalize that experience to other domains, they are likely to exaggerate considerably the likelihood of success" Due to path-dependency and slack resources, the above transformation and restructuring processes will normally proceed with a lag that varies both with decision makers' foresight and with the transactional attributes that condition such farsighted behavior (e.g.; uncertainty and complexity). In managing these processes, knowledge governance is expected to play the central role (as outlined below). One such famous example is the Village Phone program of Grameenphone, a joint venture between Telenor (62%) and Grameen Telecom Corporation of Bangladesh (38%). Grameen Telecom is a non-profit sister company of the internationally acclaimed microcredit pioneer Grameen Bank that won the Nobel Peace Prize for  2006 together with Professor Muhammad Yunus. The Village Phone enables rural people who normally cannot afford to own a mobile phone to avail the service while providing the owner of the phone (Village Phone Operators) an opportunity to earn a living. Financed with microcredit from Grameen Bank, local Village Phone Operators are renting the use of the phone to their community on a per-call basis. Village Phone programs are now exported to other similar developing countries in Africa (Uganda, Rwanda, Cameroon), not by Telenor, but Grameen Foundation, whose mission is "to replicate the success of Grameen Bank internationally by supporting microfinance institutions that embody its vision and values" (Grameen Foundation, 2006). According to Ghemawat, modular designs such as flexibility, partitioning , common platforms, and full modularity are common interrelated ways to reduce the cost of adapting to cross-country variations. The resemblance between this unbundling/disintegration hypothesis and those of  Hill and Chan Kim (1988)  are obvious. In general, leading technology and industry best practices tend to originate in the larger world outside each single company. For example, to the extent most valuable knowledge assets (mobile technologies and operating knowledge) tend to originate in upstream foreign markets, these assets must first be discovered and acquired before they can be further processed and exploited by the company's local operations. Rising transaction costs from discovering, transferring and appropriating such knowledge may then force multinational operators to terminate further acquisitions and to concentrate on their own second best technology and competence instead. Giant multinationals may still triumph, however. By exploiting their second best technology and practice to a much larger extent than what smaller players can exploit their industry best practice, a larger profit may still be returned in the former than in the latter case. AT Kearney is the consulting company providing critical benchmarking analysis based on data supplied by the industry itself, gradually also allowing it to provide best industry practices (AT Kearney, 2007b). Copying may be considered illegal if patent rights protect such knowledge or technology. Such rights have two different functions. They may protect the technology from leaking out to competitors or other companies, and they may facilitate trading by making it possible to sell or to license out the right to use the technology (on more or less exclusive terms). According to Blycroft Publishing there were roughly 255 active MVNOs, as of November, 2007 (http://www.mvnodirectory.com/). In this case, however, the global operator (Vodafone) proactively sought to mitigate such hazards by buying into the more efficient local operator (Bharti), thus illustrating Williamson's (1999a) more general "hazards mitigating" proposition cited above. Impressive attempts at global consolidation of the telecom services industry were first made in fixed communication, then in mobile communications, both mainly by acquisitions. Whereas these attempts generally failed in international fixed communication (Ulset, 2008), they are still pending in international mobile communications. Almost eight years ago, CFO Richard Moat of the global mobile operator Orange (10-15 times the value of Telenor Mobile at the time) predicted the following "In a couple of years the European mobile services market will be dominated by a couple of large operators. Orange will be one of them. Telenor has a chance to participate in the consolidation by partnering with a larger international player" (Ukeavisen Telecom, 26. October, 2000: 9 (translated from Norwegian)). Evidently, this did not happen. The European market is still fragmented and Telenor is now about the size Orange in number of subscribers. In neither company, however, strategy is a static phenomenon. Recently, Vodafone decided to withdraw from the highly developed saturated Japanese market (Economist, 2006b) and move into emerging growth markets instead (e.g.; India and Sub-Saharan Africa), similar to standard Telenor strategy. China Telecom (369 mill subscribers, 2007) is the world's largest mobile operator in number of subscribers with Vodafone on second (252 mill., 2007) and Telenor on eighth (90 mill, 2007), all in numbers of proportionate subscribers (adjusted for % ownership; see Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:   HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_network_operators"   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_network_operators ). This case study is based on interviews and discussions with top management and staffs of Telenor over several years, besides annual reports and press releases from the company. The following account of mHorizon and its successor, Global Coordination, is based on Gooderham and Ulset (2007) "Telenor's third way", EBF, Issue 31, Winter 2007: 46-49. According to Tormod Hermansen, previous Chief Executive Officer of Telenor: "The growth potential in Russia is very strong with a population of 145 million people and yet only 3.4 million cellular subscribers nationwide. VimpelCom is well positioned to strengthen its role as a leading national mobile operator in Russia by combining Telenor's expertise in telecommunications with Alfa's established record of developing businesses in Russia." The respective knowledge governance forms differ accordingly, being more decentralized at Telenor, resembling a kind of democratic hierarchy, than at Vodafone, resembling a more traditional autocratic hierarchy (similar to the hierarchy imposed on company-owned operations of plural form replicators such as McDonald's in the fast food restaurant industry, see Bradach, 1997). Both democratic and autocratic structures can be contrasted with the "hypermodern" heterarchy alternative of Hedlund (1986, 1994). Among replicator companies such as multinational mobile-phone operators, however, heterarchy corresponds to a collection of newly acquired local companies before they are fully integrated into the larger multinational enterprise, more generally termed multidomestic companies. In our setting, however, these "heterarchies" are traditional multidomestic companies rather than "hypermodern" organizations. As such, Telenor's democratic hierarchy represents something very close to what Hedlund (1994: 86) might have envisaged as the optimal mixture of heterarchical N-form features (e.g.; Telenor's Global Team) and hierarchical M-form features (e.g.; Telenor's Mobile Management Board). According to Hedlund (1994: 86): "The various trade-offs between M- and N-form show that the choice between them depends on the nature of the field in which the company operates and that the optimum probably is some mixture of the two." As pointed out by industry observers, whereas the average revenue per user (ARPU) for the first billion users was 20$ a month, it can be as low as 2$ for the next billion. Thus, the Vodafone stock gradually regained it strength, and rose 30 % last year (Economist, 2007). As exemplified in a press release from T-Mobile (04/07/03): "Telefónica Móviles, T-Mobile International and TIM (Telecom Italia Mobile) today announced a cooperation to set up an alliance to provide their customers with a unified and superior offering of products and services in all the countries where the three operators are present, thereby strengthening their ability to compete in cross-border markets. The alliance will be open to the possible incorporation of other world mobile operators interested in contributing to the enhancement of the different areas of collaboration."

Nokia to expand its 3G radio access network sharing solution for up to four operators. Nokia will expand its 3G radio access multi-operator solution to enable the sharing of a radio access network (RAN) between as many as four operators.  ... .This unique Nokia solution will now allow network sharing between three or even four operators and give additional opportunities to significantly reduce the costs of WCDMA rollout and  operation, enabling over 40% savings in initial RAN network investments," says Ari Lehtoranta, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Radio Networks, Nokia. Since open interface standards seem to have such profound effects on the limit to local growth of multinational replicators, any factors that affect evolution of open standards are of the utmost importance. Different players tend to have different interests in supporting such open standards. Whereas incumbents that want to profit as much as possible from their proprietary assets (e.g.; network facilities) would prefer to release only the peripheral interface of such assets, not their core operating functions (e.g.; the "source code" of the operating system), new entrants that want to capture a larger share of the market, regulators that want to have more competition, and consumers that want more innovative products to choose from, would all prefer to have also the core operating functions released, shared or regulated at favorable prices. Further inquiries into these matters must, however, be left for later research. Here it suffices to emphasize that whereas entry-friendly regulation may increase the utilization of existing essential facilities, incentives for building new innovative facilities may suffer. Teece (1986b) neatly summarizes Dunning's (1980, 2000) eclectic OLI (Ownership, Location, Internalization) paradigm in the following way: "A firm is likely to become multinational if (a) it has certain special assets which give it a competitive advantage over indigenous firms (the strategic advantage factor), (b) these assets are more economically utilized in production facilities in parts of the world beyond the firm's domestic markets (the location factor) and (c) the best way to obtain full value from employing the asset in foreign markets is to transfer the asset internally within the firm to another affiliated business unit (the transaction cost factor). All three must be present to explain foreign direct investment" (p. 27). _1293466858.ppt _1299159234.ppt _1293449490.ppt _1293449576.ppt
