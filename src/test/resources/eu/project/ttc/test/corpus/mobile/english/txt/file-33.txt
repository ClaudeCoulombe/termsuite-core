1 Introduction
There has been a tremendous growth in wireless communication technology over the past
decade. The significant increase in subscribers and traffic, new bandwidth consuming
applications such as gaming, music down loading and video streaming will place new
demands on capacity. The answer to the capacity demand is the provision of new
spectrum and the development of a new technology - Wideband CDMA or hereinafter
referred to as WCDMA.
WCDMA was developed in order to create a global standard for real time multimedia
services that ensured international roaming. With the support of ITU (International
Telecommunication Union) a specific spectrum was allocated - 2GHz for 3G telecom
systems. The work was later taken over by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership
Project), which is now the WCDMA specification body with delegates from all over the
world.
2 What is 3G System
UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) is a so-called "third-generation
(3G)," broadband, packet-based transmission of text, digitized voice, video, and
multimedia at data rates up to and possibly higher than 2 megabits per second (Mbps),
offering a consistent set of services to mobile computer and phone users no matter where
they are located in the world. Based on the GSM communication standard, UMTS,
endorsed by major standards bodies and manufacturers, is the planned standard for

mobile users around the world by 2002. Once UMTS is fully implemented, computer and
phone users can be constantly attached to the Internet as they travel and, as they roaming
service, have the same set of capabilities no matter where they travel to. Users will have
access through a combination of terrestrial wireless and satellite transmissions. Until
UMTS is fully implemented, users can have multi-mode devices that switch to the
currently available technology where UMTS is not yet available.

Fig l. 3G System Overview
Today's cellular telephone systems are mainly circuit-switched, with connections always
dependent on circuit availability. Packet-switched connection, using the Internet Protocol
(Internet Protocol), means that a virtual connection is always available to any other end
point in the network. It will also make it possible to provide new services, such as
alternative billing methods (pay-per-bit, pay-per-session, flat rate, asymmetric bandwidth,
and others). The higher bandwidth of UMTS also promises new services, such as video
conferencing. UMTS promises to realize the Virtual Home Environment in which a
roaming user can have the same services to which the user is accustomed when at home
or in the office, through a combination of transparent terrestrial and satellite connections.
UMTS is a network consisting of two main elements connected over a standard interface,
called Iu. These two elements are:
UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network). This is composed of Node B which
is equivalent to the GSM BTS and the Radio Network Controller (RNC) which is
equivalent to the GSM BSC. A novelty with the UTRAN concept is the existence of a
new modulation scheme: the Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and W-CDMA. This
mode offers the highest efficiency within a single system whatever the conditions-wide
area, urban, indoor coverage from outdoor, indoor, and so on. One carrier use 5 Mhz.
The Core Network. This is the equivalent of the GSM NSS. There are two options for
the implementation of 3G and the evolution of the GSM Core Network:
ATM based architecture: this R'99 architecture may reuses in some cases the two-domain
architecture of GSM/GPRS, with:
Iu-PS (Packet Switched) interface instead of Gb on the packet domain.
Iu-CS (Circuit Switched) interface instead of A on the circuit domain.
Transport Independent and multimedia architecture: this R'00 architecture is in line with

the Next Generation Networks architecture and introduces separation of control and user
planes. It also integrates multimedia capabilities.
3 Spread Spectrum System
• It is a kind of modulation system in which the modulated (spread spectrum) signal
bandwidth is much greater than the message signal bandwidth
• The spectral spreading is performed by a code that is independent of the message
signal. The same code is used at receiver to despread the received signal and to
recover the message signal.
3.1 Benefits of Spread Spectrum System
• It is very secure, without knowing the chip code it is nearly impossible to
intercept.
• A large number of codes can support a large number of users
• As a large bandwidth is used the system is less prone to distortion
• Since the power is distributed in a large bandwidth so the power spectral density
goes below to noise level so it is resistant to jamming and remain invisible to
unintended users.
• It provides asynchronous multiple access
3.2 Different Spread Spectrum Systems
3.2.1 Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum
In direct sequence spread spectrum, the stream of information to be transmitted is divided
into small pieces, each of which is allocated across to a frequency channel across the
spectrum. A data signal at the point of transmission is combined with a higher data-rate
bit sequence (also known as a chipping code) that divides the data according to a
spreading ratio. The redundant chipping code helps the signal resist interference and also
enables the original data to be recovered if data bits are damaged during transmission.
3.2.2. Frequency Hoping
In an FH-CDMA system, a transmitter "hops" between available frequencies according to
a specified algorithm, which can be either random or preplanned. The transmitter
operates in synchronization with a receiver, which remains tuned to the same center
3 Pradipta Biswas M. Tech., SIT, IIT KGP

WCDMA-Technology For 3 g Cellular Systems
frequency as the transmitter. A short burst of data is transmitted on a narrowband. Then,
the transmitter tunes to another frequency and transmits again. The receiver thus is
capable of hopping its frequency over a given bandwidth several times a second,
transmitting on one frequency for a certain period of time, then hopping to another
frequency and transmitting again. Frequency hopping requires a much wider bandwidth
than is needed to transmit the same information using only one carrier frequency. The
Near-Far problem of DS/SS is avoided here. FH-CDMA devices use less power and are
generally cheaper, but the performance of DS-CDMA systems is usually better and more
reliable. The biggest advantage of frequency hopping lies in the coexistence of several
access points in the same area, something not possible with direct sequence.
3.2.3 Hybrid System: DS/(F)FH
The DSfFFH Spread Spectrum technique is a combination of direct-sequence and
frequency-hopping. One data bit is divided over a number of (let NPH) frequency-hop
channel (carrier frequencies). In each frequency-hop channel one complete PN-code of
length N is added to the data signal (in figure, NFH is taken to be 5).

Fig 2. Example of DS/(F)FH System
As the FH-sequence and the PN-codes are coupled, an address is a combination of an FH-
sequence and NPH PN-codes. To bound the hit-chance (the chance that two users share
the same frequency channel in the same time) the frequency-hop sequences are chosen in
such a way that two transmitters with different FH-sequences share at most two
frequencies at the same time (timeshift is random).

4 Code Division Multiple Access
CDMA is a form of multiplexing, which allows numerous signals to occupy a single
transmission channel, optimizing the use of available bandwidth. The technology is used
in ultra-high-frequency (UHF) cellular telephone systems in the 800-MHz and 1.9-GHz
bands.
CDMA employs analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) in combination with spread
spectrum technology. Audio input is first digitized into binary elements. The frequency of
the transmitted signal is then made to vary according to a defined pattern (code), so it can
be intercepted only by a receiver whose frequency response is programmed with the same
code, so it follows exactly along with the transmitter frequency. There are trillions of
possible frequency-sequencing codes; this enhances privacy and makes cloning difficult.

Fig 3. CDMA Procedure
5 WCDMA
The original CDMA standard, also known as CDMA One and still common in cellular
telephones in the U.S., offers a transmission speed of only up to 14.4 Kbps in its single
channel form and up to 115 Kbps in an eight-channel form. The next version of CDMA,
CDMA2000, also known as IMT-CDMA Multi-Carrier or 1xRTT, can support mobile
data communications at speeds ranging from 144 Kbps to 2 Mbps.
In CDMAOne and CDMA2000, a 1.25 MHz wide radio signal is multiplied by a
spreading signal (which is a pseudo-noise code sequence) with a higher rate than the data
rate of the message. The resultant signal appears as seemingly random, but if the intended
recipient has the right code, this process is reversed and the original signal is extracted.
Uses of unique codes mean that the same frequency is repeated in all cells, which is
commonly referred to as a frequency re-use of 1.
WCDMA is a step further in the CDMA technology. It uses a 5 MHz wide radio signal
and a chip rate of

WCDMA-Technology For 3g Cellular Systems
3.84 Mcps, which is about three times higher than the chip rate of CDMA2000 (1.22
Mcps).
The main benefits of a wideband carrier with a higher chiprate are:
• Support for higher bit rates
• Higher spectrum efficiency thanks to improved trunking efficiency (i.e. a better
statistical averaging)
• Higher QoS
Further, experience from second-generation systems like GSM and cdmaOne has enabled
improvements to be incorporated in WCDMA. Focus has also been put on ensuring that
as much as possible of WCDMA operators' investments in GSM equipment can be re-
used. Examples are the re-use and evolution of the core network, the focus on co-siting
and the support of GSM handover. In order to use GSM handover the subscribers need
dual mode handsets.

The Physical Layer (Layer l) offers T ranspert Channels to the MAC layer. There are
different types of transport channels with different characteristics of the transmission.
Common transport channels can be shared by multiple handsets (e. g. FACH, RACH,
DSCH, BCH, PCH). Dedicated transport channels (DCH) are assigned to only one
handset at a time. The transmission functions of the physical layer include channel coding
and interleaving, multiplexing of transport channels, mapping to physical channels,
spreading, modulation and power amplification, with corresponding functions for
reception. The following is the physical layer frame structure of WCDMA.

Fig 5. WCDMA Frame Structure
A frequency and a code characterize a physical channel. The specifications include two
modes: the FDD mode (Frequency Division Duplex) and the TDD mode (Time Division
Duplex). The FDD mode is the mainstream mode that operators are now deploying in
WCDMA. The TDD mode may eventually be deployed as well, as a complement to the
FDD mode.
The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol (Layer 2) offers logical channels to the
layers above. The logical channels are distinguished by the different type of information
they carry. The main two types are,
a. Dedicated channel -reserved for a single user only.
Support fast power control and soft handover.
b. Common channel- can be used by any user at any time.
Don't support soft handover but some support fast power control.
Here is a complete mapping of different transport channels to physical channels.

Table l, Mapping from Transport to Physical Channels
The MAC layer performs scheduling and mapping of logical channel data onto the
transport channels provided by the physical layer. Also, for common transport channels,
the MAC layer adds addressing information to distinguish data flows intended for dif-
ferent handsets. One major difference to GSM is the possibility to dynamically switch
one logical channel (data flow) onto different transport channel types, e. g. based on the
activity of the subscriber. This is called channel type switching.
The Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol (Layer 2) operates in one of three modes:
transparent, unacknowledged or acknowledged mode. It performs segmentation/re-
assembly functions and, in acknowledged mode, provides an assured mode delivery ser-
vice by use of retransmission. RLC provides a service both for the RRC signaling (the
Signaling Radio Bearer) and for the user data transfer (the Radio Access Bearer).
The Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol (Layer 3) provides control of the handset
from the RNC. It includes functions to control radio bearers, physical channels, mapping
of the different channel types, handover, measurement and other mobility procedures.
Because of the flexibility of the WCDMA radio interface, this is a fairly complex
protocol.

7 WCDMA System Overview
7.1 Radio Access Network (RAN) Architecture
The main purpose of the WCDMA Radio Access Network is to provide a connection
between the handset and the core network and to isolate all the radio issues from the core
network. The advantage is one core network supporting multiple access technologies.
The WCDMA Radio Access Network consists of two types of nodes:
a. Radio Base Station (Node B)
The Radio Base Station handles the radio transmission and reception to/from the handset
over the radio interface (Uu). It is controlled from the Radio Network Controller via the
Iub interface. One Radio Base Station can handle one or more cells.
b. Radio Network Controller (RNC)
The Radio Network Controller is the node that controls all WCDMA Radio Access
Network functions. It connects the WCDMA Radio Access Network to the

core network via the lu interface. There are two distinct roles for the RNC, to serve and to
control. The Serving RNC has overall control of the handset that is connected to
WCDMA Radio Access Network. It controls the connection on the lu interface for the
handset and it terminates several protocols in the contact between the handset and the
WCDMA Radio Access Network.
The Controlling RNC has the overall control of a particular set of cells, and their
associated base stations. When a handset must use resources in a cell not controlled by its
Serving RNC, the Serving RNC must ask the Controlling RNC for those resources. This
request is made via the Iur interface, which connects the RNCs with each other. In this
case, the Controlling RNC is also said to be a Drift RNC for this particular handset. This

kind of operation is primarily needed to be able to provide soft handover throughout the
network.
7.1.1 Radio Access Bearers
The main service offered by WCDMA RAN is the Radio Access Bearer (RAB). To
establish a call connection between the handset and the base station a RAB is needed. Its
characteristics are different depending on what kind of service/information to be
transported.
The RAB carries the subscriber data between the handset and the core network. It is
composed of one or more Radio Access Bearers between the handset and the Serving
RNC, and one lu bearer between the Serving RNC and the core network.
3GPP has defined four different quality classes of Radio Access Bearers:
• Conversational (used for e.g. voice telephony)
- low delay, strict ordering
• Streaming (used for e.g. watching a video clip)
- moderate delay, strict ordering
• Interactive (used for e. g. web surfing)
- moderate delay
• Background (used for e. g. file transfer)
- no delay requirement
Both the Conversational and Streaming RABs require a certain reservation of resources
in the network, and are primarily meant for real-time services. They differ mainly in that
the Streaming RAB tolerates a higher delay, appropriate for one-way real-time services.
The Interactive and Background RABs are so called 'best effort', i.e. no resources are
reserved and the throughput depends on the load in the cell. The only difference is that
the Interactive RAB provides a priority mechanism.
The RAB is characterized by certain Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, such as bit rate
and delay. The core network will select a RAB with appropriate QoS based on the service
request from the subscriber, and ask the RNC to provide such a RAB.
7.2. Transports in WCDMA Radio Access Network
The WCDMA Radio Access Network nodes communicate with each other over a
transport network. The 3GPP specification provides a very clear split between radio
related (WCDMA) functionality and the transport technology, meaning that there is no
particular bias to any technology. The transport network is initially based on ATM, but IP
will soon be included as an option.
