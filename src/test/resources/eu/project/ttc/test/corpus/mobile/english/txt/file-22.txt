I. The Rise of Mobile Data and
Smartphone Use
Mobile phones have been a global phenomenon for over a decade now, with
worldwide mobile subscribers now over 2 billion. In developed countries, 3G
networks started widespread rollout several years ago, offering broadband-like
speeds of 1M and above to the handset. Though cellular data services are still
largely based on simple communications such as e-mail or SMS, 3G adoption is
increasingly driven by the need for high speed data, for instance using a 3G
network card inserted into a laptop.
According to the January 2007 edition of our biannual Mobile and WiFi Phones and
Subscribers worldwide market share and forecast service, total mobile service
subscribers reached 2.5B in 2006, with 7% of these being 3G subscribers. The total
figure is forecast to reach 3.6B by 2010, with 11% being 3G users. In developed
markets such as North America, Western Europe and parts of Asia-Pacific such
as Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong the proportion of 3G users is much
higher.
3G adoption is being increasingly driven by the need for high speed data-using
a 3G network card inserted into a laptop, for instance-as well as new content-
rich multimedia services, including high quality streaming video, fast downloads
of high resolution images and other large files, and interactive services and
applications such as advanced gaming.
In many organizations, mobile phones, smartphones, and other cellular devices
are becoming primary communication devices-employees move around
throughout the day attending meetings, and large organizations often host
visiting customers or employees. In our study published in October 2006, User
Plans for Wireless LANs and Mobility: North America 2006, we interviewed 240 IT
and network managers from small, medium, and large organizations across a
range of vertical sectors about their use of wireless technologies and mobile
services.
Exhibit 1 below shows that cellular is the most popular voice call technology,
second only to desk-based land-line phones (which decline in usage from 2006 to

by 2008. Employees need to be constantly connected while they are mobile, but
lack of coverage impedes cellular phone use.

II. Why In-Building Coverage is
Essential
Mobile connections rely on coverage from macrocells, which are deployed on
masts or high buildings to provide coverage to an area of several kilometers.
When a mobile subscriber is inside a building, however, building materials such
as concrete and steel attenuate (weaken) cellular signals-although coverage
from the macrocell does penetrate the building, the signal strength is reduced
and can be nonexistent in some areas.

Technologies An Evaluation of In-Building Wireless Coverage
In many locations within a building, the cellular signal quality may also be
degraded because of conflicting signals from multiple macrocells. (This can be
especially problematic in high-rise buildings.) In addition, because macrocells
provide coverage for a wide area that may house numerous high user-density
buildings, there could be capacity limitations in any given building due to
demand from other users in the area. This can lead to longer call setup times, and
calls being blocked or even dropped altogether.
Mobile operators are investing significantly on network upgrades for 3G
services. In the 4Q06 edition of our Radio Access Network Equipment and
Subscribers quarterly worldwide market share and forecast service, we tracked
the W-CDMA radio access network equipment market-including NodeBs and
radio network controllers at $8.3B in 2006, rising to $12.2B by 2010.
Unless mobile operators reinforce macrocellular investment with an effective in-
building coverage strategy, they will inhibit their opportunities to grow their 3G
subscriber base and generate next-generation service revenue for high speed
services. Rising deployment of 3G-based data services will require wireless
operators to boost coverage in large commercial and multi-tenant buildings
because of the need to provide low latency, high speed access networks for 3G
services.
In addition, sole-tenant enterprises and multi-tenant building owners are
increasingly choosing to deploy their own in-building coverage solutions to
facilitate employee or tenant communications.

In User Plans for Wireless LANs and Mobility: North America 2006, we asked survey
respondents to choose from a series of possible mobility strategies those that
describe the approaches their organization is taking. Exhibit 2 below shows that
using cellular services for mobile voice on-site is rated by 50%. Using cellular
services for data on-site, a strategy for 26%, is likely to grow over the next few
years, driven by the desire to carry a single device for both voice and data as far
as possible.

3G services are not necessarily voice-oriented, and as such tend to be used in a
pedestrian or stationary mode (users, though wireless, are mostly static). This
reinforces the need for pervasive coverage, as the user does not want to have to
move around to achieve a reliable connection to the network.

Strategies An Evaluation of In-Building Wireless Coverage
In-building coverage is crucial to user acceptance of 3G services, because a high
proportion of cellular traffic originates from inside buildings. Despite many
cellular users being frustrated with less-than-perfect coverage inside buildings,
more and more people continue to choose cellular as their sole form of
telecommunication.
This creates a quality of service need, because simply providing coverage in itself
is not enough-the coverage must deliver high performance in terms of capacity
and consistency, not just availability.
III. In-Building Coverage Challenges
Macrocellular radio signals attenuate as they pass through the fabric of a
building, resulting in dead zones, where there is no coverage at all or only
intermittent coverage, so the primary challenge is to provide consistent, robust
signal strength throughout the building to maximize the performance of
handsets and devices attached to the network.
To achieve this, there are several key considerations. It is necessary to determine
exactly where the coverage is weak-it may be in several isolated areas or across
the building or campus. Also, interference can be a significant problem, often
caused by electronic instruments located within the building. Not all in-building
wireless systems offer control over the amount of radio energy delivered at each
internal antenna; however, some can control this energy, limiting interference
and loss of signal strength.
The first step is to do a professional site survey, identifying coverage deficiencies,
determining the impact of outside interference, and outlining the amount and
type of equipment needed to establish a robust link budget (measurement of the
quality of the network connection) throughout the building.
Technical choices for in-building systems range from a simple band-aid that will
fix a coverage issue in a specific area, to a complete, campus-wide, multi-
technology architecture. Aside from technical considerations, deployment of in-
building wireless coverage can be disruptive and expensive, depending on the
choice of system. Systems vary in their scalability (a consideration if future
expansion is planned)-some may not be flexible when it comes to being
Copyright © 2007 by Infonetics Research, Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction is prohibited. 5 Infonetics Research, Inc.
upgraded to enable future services to be delivered. Some only need upgrades to
centralized electronics, and others require fundamental alterations to antennas.
While indoor coverage is a challenge for all cellular services, supporting
pervasive 3G services indoors is even more challenging. Most 3G services, such
as HSDPA and EV-DO, are currently being offered in higher frequencies, so
operators can re-utilize the lower, cellular frequencies to support high-QAM W-
CDMA based protocols. Also, newly available spectrum is mostly in higher
frequencies, with the trend being a shift from 800/900Mhz to 1800/1900 to
2100Mhz. These higher frequencies are more easily attenuated by building
materials. This can be a greater challenge for multi-level buildings, and it is not
feasible-or sometimes legal-for operators to simply ratchet up the power to
overcome signal dissipation.
Fundamentally, there is a need for a better link budget to support data
applications. (The link budget represents the relationship between power
transmitted and signal strength, and is reduced as the data rate goes up.) HSDPA
in particular suffers from poor in-building penetration, and brings an additional
challenge for coverage, namely the reduction of the link budget.
Finally, it is increasingly important that improving cell phone coverage in an
office complex is achieved with an appropriate commercial arrangement for the
mobile operator and the user organization. Several business models exist
specifying which party bears the cost of that infrastructure:
  Operator pays: the operator will deploy an in-building solution in
exchange for a commitment of x number of handsets for x number of
years; this is by far the most common arrangement
  Shared cost #1: the operator and user organization share the costs of the
solution; the user organization allows access to its existing in-building
cable infrastructure (fiber, for instance), and the operator pays for the
system hardware and the RF source
  Shared cost #2: if the user organization is unwilling or unable to commit
to the necessary number of handsets required for the operator to pay for
the entire solution, the user organization could pay for a portion of it
  User organization pays: if the user organization requires a solution for
multiple operators, it will generally have to bear the costs of the entire
solution

IV. High-Level Technology Comparison
A. Active and Passive Distributed Antenna Systems
Distributed antenna systems (DASs) have one primary advantage in that they are
based on technology that is proven as scalable: the mobile network itself. These
systems operate by using one centralized radio source-and extending its signal
to multiple antennas deployed at specific points within a building.
Some DASs use large coaxial cable to distribute the signal through a facility.
These systems are considered passive because they do not use managed
electronics in the distribution network. They are generally used for small
coverage applications where the length of a coaxial cable run is not an issue.
Length is an issue because the signal in a passive system attenuates over longer
cable runs, leading to inconsistent signal strength and making system
engineering difficult. Each antenna's coverage area will vary depending on the
length of coax to which it is attached, which could mean that the whole system
will need re-engineering if more capacity or coverage areas are added. In
addition, passive DAS is often expensive and time-consuming to install because
of the specialist requirements of installing heavy coaxial cable.
Copyright © 2007 by Infonetics Research, Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction is prohibited. 7 Infonetics Research, Inc.
Active distributed antenna systems use Cat-5/CATV and fiber cabling and
combine active electronic hubs, fiber optics, and active radio access units to
distribute the signal from a single, centrally located radio source, as shown in
Exhibit 3 below.

(170 meters with Cat-5/6 directional or 
extender) omni antenna
Because the signal does not degrade, it has the same strength at every antenna
point, regardless of the distance from the central radio. Since every antenna is
simply an extension of the centralized radio source, there is no interference
among antennas and no limit on the number of antennas that can be deployed
within a building, or where they can be located. The signal consistency means
there is no need to traffic engineer the system at the individual antenna level to
deliver pervasive coverage for high user-density areas.
Some active DAS systems support optimum signal strength throughout the
interiors of buildings that span hundreds of thousands of square feet. To increase
capacity, additional radios can be added to the macro base station. DAS antennas
themselves are relatively small and inexpensive, and can deliver maximum
8 Copyright © 2007 by Infonetics Research, Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction is prohibited. An Evaluation of In-Building Wireless Coverage
output power to support voice and high speed data. Also, active DAS uses
standard cabling to connect hubs to RAUs and remote antennas, reducing
deployment costs and time when compared with passive DAS-unlike passive
systems that require specialized cable installation, regular IT staff can easily roll
out the infrastructure with commonly used wiring.
Sizing is another criterion for delivering effective in-building wireless coverage;
the size of the building, the capacity of the base stations (number of radio
channels), the number of services (cellular operators, WiFi, WiMAX, public
safety, etc.), and the quality of the signal-the average signal strength
throughout the building-must all be factored in.
Historically, in-building wireless systems were deployed using large half-inch
coaxial cables. Because RF signals attenuate as they pass through the cable, the
longer the coax run, the weaker the signal coming from the antenna. Though it is
possible improve the performance of passive cable to an extent by using a larger
diameter cable, this is often impractical.
Adding active amplifiers in the system boosts the signal in both directions.
Placing the amplifier next to the antenna has been imperative, due to:
  The introduction of services at higher frequencies, particularly AWS
spectrum in North America and UMTS in Europe and Asia
  Data-specific protocols like HSDPA and EV-DO, which require a much
more robust link budget to deliver their advertised data rates
However, placing an amplifier behind 150 meters of coax has significant impact
on HSDPA being delivered in the UMTS (2.1GHz) band, so the ultimate iteration
of active system technology places the amplifiers at the end of Ethernet type
cabling (fiber and Cat-5) so cable attenuation essentially disappears as an issue.
A middle ground solution also exists-hybrid fiber/coax systems. These systems
offer some of the advantages of active systems (and are generally classified as
active systems because they use electronics), in that they have a fiber link
(connecting the head-end unit with the remote unit), which provides good
performance and extra reach.
Conversely, hybrid fiber/coax systems still have many of the drawbacks of
passive systems, because they use coax cabling to distribute the RF signal from
Copyright © 2007 by Infonetics Research, Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction is prohibited. 9 Infonetics Research, Inc.
their remote units (generally placed in wiring closets) to the antennas in the
ceilings. This means that the final amplifier in the system is located some
distance from the antenna point, and the coax used to get to that antenna
introduces performance issues such as signal loss and uplink noise.
Both active and passive DAS can support multiple carriers in a single antenna
system, with a straightforward centralized or hub electronics upgrade required
to support new carriers or services. Deployment of multi-carrier distributed
antenna systems is being driven by the need for dual 2G/3G support, multi-
tenant and enterprise demands, so it is an increasingly important capability to
support.
Historically, passive DAS systems based on RF over coaxial cable dominated the
market, but this has changed rapidly. Now, active systems using RF over fiber
and Cat-5/CATV cable are leading the market because they offer a more
economical, better performing alternative, and are also much more flexible in
terms of meeting future needs, such as more operators, more channels, high
bandwidth for data applications, etc.
B. Picocells and Femtocells
Picocells are a small form factor base transceiver station with a range of several
hundred feet that can be deployed to create in-building cellular coverage where
macrocell signal strength is insufficient to support high user-density. IP-based
picocells support a flat 3G network architecture by integrating multiple network
elements-including radio network controller functions-into a single device. To
increase in-building system capacity with picocells, it may be necessary to add
more radio resources at every picocell location in the building to support more
users-a costly and time-consuming undertaking.
Femtocells are smaller home base stations that allow wireless users to
communicate across any IP access network using a standard mobile handset.
Some of the potential benefits of using femtocells for indoor coverage include:
the ability to provide capacity that scales in line with subscriber demand, a
reduced requirement to deploy additional macrocells to support indoor users,
and an operational expenditure requirement that is kept in check by IP backhaul
paid for by the customer.
10 Copyright © 2007 by Infonetics Research, Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction is prohibited. An Evaluation of In-Building Wireless Coverage
To provide adequate coverage in large buildings, it might be necessary to use
multiple picocells or femtocells. However, because each cell uses the same
frequency, a large area within the building will receive multiple picocell or
femtocell signals with similar signal strengths, causing local interference issues
and prohibiting high data rates.
Each picocell or femtocell requires backhaul connectivity. Femtocells enable
mobile operators to route traffic through the IP network and significantly reduce
opex requirements for backhaul, and at the same time reduce the load on the BSC
or RNC-susceptible failure points in the mobile access network. However, the
location of a picocell or femtocell may be determined by the need for backhaul
connectivity for each cell, and may not be the optimal location to provide the best
coverage. In contrast, DAS installations place the radio source in a convenient
location for backhaul-typically the communications room or data center-and
the antennas may be placed as needed for optimum coverage.
The management of multiple small radio base stations in a network could create
interference issues with the macro network, and this problem is not helped by
the fact that femtocells are currently proprietary.
Both technical and economic challenges must be overcome before femtocells can
be widely deployed. On the radio access side, equipment suppliers still need to
prove that these devices can coexist with the macro network without negatively
affecting its performance. Integration with core network infrastructure is also
critical, yet there is uncertainty about how best to achieve this
In summary, picocells and femtocells are:
  Newer technologies that reduce the complexity of the components that
need to be installed
  Architected for small spaces like homes or small offices, not for large
enterprise buildings or campuses
  Single band, single operator
  Not really scalable building blocks
In the future, it is highly likely that picocells will be used in combination with
DAS systems to cover larger venues

C. Voice over IP over Wireless LAN
VoIP is an increasingly significant application driver for wireless LAN adoption,
as voice capability cements the case for mobile networking; the reverse is also
true: voice becomes a more powerful tool when enabled across a wireless
platform, and this potential symbiosis has generated much interest and activity
in the VoIP over wireless LAN (VoWLAN) space, with IP PBX, wireless LAN
infrastructure, and IP handset vendors all pitching in to build out the wireless
VoIP ecosystem.
In User Plans for Wireless LANs and Mobility: North America 2006, we asked survey
respondents intending to deploy voice over wireless LAN (VoWLAN) to choose
among a list of strategies the ones that best describe their approach to VoIP over
their wireless LAN. Exhibit 4 shows that the top two responses are cautious:
evaluate it but continue using cellular, or eventually deploy it to replicate the
user's VoIP profile across both the wired or wireless LAN. Many respondents
still regard VoIP as a future technology, an attractive idea but not ready for
prime time-and in the meantime cellular, albeit more expensive (in terms of
"air-time" charges), works fine. (Please see chart, next page.)

It is worth noting that VoWLAN is not free of charge (though many
organizations perceive it to be), as it incurs significant deployment and
management costs. In addition, VoWLAN requires the replacement of the
handset, either with a single-mode WiFi-only device, or a dual-mode
WiFi/cellular handset. Neither of these are cheap options, particularly when
having to supply many hundreds of employees with new phones.
Upgrading an existing data-centric WLAN infrastructure to support voice
requires four to five times as many access points as originally deployed,
significantly impacting total cost of ownership for wireless VoIP.

Strategies Infonetics Research, Inc.
On the handset side, user organizations have two choices for in-building wireless
VoIP:
  Single mode WiFi-only phones; this means keeping cellular phones for
wide area communication, which in turn means employees have to carry
two phones
  Dual-mode WiFi/cellular phones: these are currently very expensive with
limited handset choices, and it is unclear when volumes will be sufficient
to drive costs down to parity with mobile phone prices
End-user organizations certainly question whether or not WLAN architectures
are ready to fully support VoIP, which is not what they were designed for.
VoWLAN is not standardized. Also, VoWLAN has not proven that it has
overcome the scalability challenges of only supporting a dozen or so users per
access point, and though protocols are being developed, there is currently no
QoS guarantee, so calls are subject to drop-out, and roaming does not always
work seamlessly. Because 802.11 uses unlicensed spectrum, interference can be a
problem and can be subject to contention issues if there are multiple users or
networks-or microwave ovens-in the same vicinity.
VoWLAN represents two technologies-VoIP and WLAN-that are still
maturing and converging. End-users are beginning to understand that they need
a harmonious deployment of both technologies to leverage the full benefits of
each. It is likely that the technical challenges faced by VoWLAN will be
overcome in the future, but it is not yet a challenger to cellular as the primary
mobile voice technology used by organizations today.
V. Integration of Multiple Technologies
Active DAS uses electronics to deliver wireless signals from an RF source
through hubs in the campus communications center, and from there via fiber to
expansion hubs in each building, which are linked via standard Cat-5/CATV
cabling to the remote antennas. On a fundamental level, they represent a
combination of wireless and wired technologies. The RF source could be a
standard base station, a microcell, a repeater/BDA, or on some occasions a
picocell.
14 Copyright © 2007 by Infonetics Research, Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction is prohibited. An Evaluation of In-Building Wireless Coverage
But the technology integration can be taken farther. Some active DAS systems are
a good example of how multiple technologies can be integrated to deliver
improved in-building wireless coverage, because they support multi-frequency
coverage-such as GSM and W-CDMA frequencies-and can be upgraded to
improve capacity, coverage, or support future services without changing antenna
placements. By supporting multiple frequencies in a single in-building system,
building or facilities owners can support multiple carriers, and tenants retain a
choice of service provider.
DAS can also be combined with picocells, leveraging the benefits of each, to
provide an in-building solution that delivers the highest performance and lowest
interference while minimizing network integration requirements. The active DAS
system enables a higher load of the picocell by expanding its coverage area. If the
building is modestly sized, and the macrocellular signal is not dominant within
the building, a single standalone picocell base station would be adequate to
provide pervasive coverage. However, buildings of several thousand square feet
would require a higher output power of the pico base station, which could result
in interference with macrocellular signals. Using an active DAS in combination
with a picocell addresses this problem, because the DAS effectively distributes
the picocell's radio signal throughout the facility without requiring higher output
power.
VI. Public vs Private Mobile Networks
There are multiple markets for in-building wireless solutions, including private
buildings and campuses, public buildings, and facilities such as subway stations.
Mobile operators are leading efforts with building owners, suppliers, and
enterprises to unlock the in-building market-a major strategic change from only
a few years ago.
Providing in-building coverage is not just a technology issue but a business
issue. Although the value proposition for improving in-building coverage for
tenants is well understood, the revenue model for the mobile operator has not
been as clear. Mobile operators often face an increasing tightening of their capital
expenditures and must evaluate every potential installation from an ROI
perspective. They may have different strategies for providing coverage to a
Copyright © 2007 by Infonetics Research, Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction is prohibited. 15 Infonetics Research, Inc.
particular building or facility, but all mobile operators base their evaluations on
the same fundamental criteria-reducing risk of churn.
Generally, operators fund the equipment and installation costs in return for the
promise of an extensive, extended service contract. The main thrust is to prevent
a significant customer from going to a competitor, and therefore the ROI is
analyzed against the cost of reacquiring that customer. However, operators will
demand some type of monogamy, and will exclude other operators from
deploying equipment for the duration of the contract.
By deploying capacity indoors, where it is most needed, mobile operators are in
effect extending the public network into the private domain. They share or
absorb the cost of deploying the in-building coverage system and retain
responsibility for operations and maintenance. In the immediate term, they gain
greater flexibility to introduce disruptive pricing and bundling strategies,
allowing them to accelerate capture of wireline voice minutes and increase the
number of subscribers and the revenue from the building tenants. Over the
longer term, there is the opportunity to develop revenue from high speed 3G
services, potentially selling upgraded mobile devices to the customer, and lock-in
usage for outdoors also.
Multi-carrier coverage solutions allow for improved coverage within large
buildings and across-campuses without tying the resident enterprise or
organization to one particular cellular operator. For large public facilities such as
airports or convention centers, there is a clear benefit for the operator in
providing pervasive, multi-carrier in-building coverage-there is a constant flow
of people, many of whom will use their mobile devices to communicate. This
potentially generates significant revenue that is worth the investment. Usually
such facilities are carrier-neutral, so in such circumstances an active DAS system
is a logical solution.
When deployed appropriately, in-building coverage is more about providing for
people, rather than physical space. By providing better coverage inside a
building where there is high use density and thus high demand, the operator
could be offsetting the need to boost coverage at the macro level, which would be
a more expensive means of making provision for the high traffic volumes
generated by a user base concentrated in a specific location.
16 Copyright © 2007 by Infonetics Research, Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction is prohibited. An Evaluation of In-Building Wireless Coverage
In terms of owner-funded coverage systems, the building owner can offer a
tangible amenity to tenants and/or employees while retaining full control over
which carriers and services are offered.
VII. Conclusions
  Mobile phones are the most widely used wireless connection, and the
number of applications is increasing rapidly; users are becoming more
reliant on their mobile device, not just for voice, but for an increasing range
of data applications; in addition, the value of voice over mobile has
increased; high value individuals (corporate executives, doctors, technical
specialists, etc.) need to remain in contact with their colleagues and maintain
mobility
  In-building wireless coverage is often poor; macrocellular radio signals
attenuate as they pass through the fabric of a building, resulting in dead
zones, where there is no coverage at all or only intermittent coverage
  Despite the buzz about VoWLAN and dual-mode phones, cellular extension
is still the main technology used to improve indoor mobile coverage
  Active and passive DAS can support multiple carriers in a single antenna
system, with a straightforward centralized or hub electronics upgrade
required to support new carriers or services
  Active distributed antenna systems, which use Cat-5 or fiber cabling,
combine active electronic hubs, fiber optics, and active radio access units to
distribute the signal from a single, centrally located radio source, and then
propagate it through multiple remote antennas throughout the building;
active systems offer clear advantages for larger buildings, campus
environments and for the distribution of new, data-centric protocols such as
EV-DO and HSDPA
  Picocells or femtocells can also improve in-building mobile coverage, but for
larger buildings it might be necessary to use multiple picocells or femtocells;
because each cell uses the same frequency, multiple cell signals with similar
signal strengths will be produced, causing local interference issues and
prohibiting high data rates; these are effective single-unit solutions, but they
are not good building blocks for wide-area deployments

  DAS can be combined with picocells, leveraging the benefits of each, to
provide an in-building solution that delivers the highest performance and
lowest interference while minimizing network integration requirements;
however, this may not be appropriate for all installations; mixing picocells
does not work on passive DAS because picocells have insufficient power to
effectively drive a passive DAS
  By enhancing in-building cellular performance, mobile operators can
persuade some enterprises NOT to use VoIP over wireless LAN in the future
  The need to improve the quality and reliability of indoor voice and data
connections will drive mobile operators to invest heavily in systems that
boost wireless coverage within large commercial buildings and multi-tenant
dwellings, to protect against churn by major customers
  Multi-carrier coverage solutions allow for improved coverage within large
buildings and across-campuses without tying the resident enterprise or
organization to one particular cellular operator
