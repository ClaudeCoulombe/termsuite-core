Early first and second generation (IG and 2G, respectively) wireless telecommunica-
tion networks were isolated in the sense that their signaling and control infrastructure
was not directly accessible to end subscribers. The vision of the next generation 3G
wireless telecommunication network is to use IP technologies for control and trans-
port. The introduction of IP technologies has opened up a new generation of IP-based
services that must interwork with traditional 3G wireless telecommunication net-
works. Cross Network Services will use a combination of Internet-based data and dam
from the wireless telecommunication network to provide services to the wireless sub-
scriber. They will be multi-vendor, multi-domain, and will cater to a wide variety of
needs. An example of such a Cross Network Service is the Email Based Call Forward-
ing Service (CFS), where the status ofthe subscriber's email inbox is used to trigger
call forwarding in the wireless telecommunication network.
A security risk is introduced by providing Internet connectivity to the 3G networks
in that certain attacks can be easily enforced on the wireless telecommunication net-
work indirectly from the IP networks. These Cross Infrastructure Cyber Attacks are
simple to execute and yet have serious effects. In this paper we present a unique attack
taxonomy in which we consider the Cross Infrastructure Cyber attacks in addition to
the standard Single Infrastructure attacks, some of which have already been studied. In
presenting the taxonomy of attacks on the 3G Network, we classify the attacks into
three dimensions summarized in Table I.

To understand such attacks, we have developed a detailed abstract model of the 3G
telecommunications network infrastructure. Each entity is modeled into atomic proc-
essing units (agents) and data stores (permanent and cached) as shown in Figure l. We
map attacks to these specific modules in each entity as discussed below.

Fig. 1. Attack Propagation in CFS with simplified abstract model
The CFS forwards a call to a subscriber's voice mail if there is no email from the
caller in its inbox of over a certain age; otherwise the call is forwarded to the sub-
scriber's cellular phone. The CFS Mail Server Agent in the CFS periodically fetches
email stored in the Post Ojdce data source of the Mail Server. This data is stored in
the Email data cache of the CFS. When there is an incoming call for the CF sub-
scriber, the Subscribed Services Support Agent in the MSC will query the CF Server
on how to forward the call. The CFS Filtering Agent will check its Email data cache,
and if there is appropriate email from the caller, the call is forwarded to the sub-
scriber's cellular phone.
The propagation of the attack from the Mail Server to the CFS, and finally the 3G-
network entity, is illustrated in Fig l. Using any well-known Mail Server vulnerabili-
ties the attacker may compromise the Mail Server and corrupt the Post Ojjice dam
source by deleting emails from certain people from whom the victim is expecting
calls. The CFS Mail Server Agent queries the Mail Transaction Agent for emails from
the Post Ojfice data source and the Mail Transaction Agent will pass on the conupted
email data to the CFS Mail Server Agent. The CFS Mail Server Agent will cache the
email data in its Email data cache. When the Subscribed Services Support Agent in
the MSC entity of the 3G network sends out a 'How to forward the call?' query to the
CF Server, the CF Server will check its corrupt Email data cache, find that there are
no emails from the caller, and route the call incorrectly. Thus the effect of the attack
on the Internet Mail Server has propagated to the 3G network. This is a classic exam-
ple of a Dimension.Â· I-Level V Cross Infrastructure Cyber Attack, where the attacker
gains access to the Cross Network Server and attacks by modifying data in the data
source of the Cross Network Server.
The full paper presents a model for 3G networks, a set of Cross Network Services,
and a full attack taxonomy including Cross Infrastructure Cyber attacks.
