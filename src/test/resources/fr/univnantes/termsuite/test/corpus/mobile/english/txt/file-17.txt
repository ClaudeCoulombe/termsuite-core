May 5, 2009 As elsewhere, wireless markets play a crucial role in Latin American economic growth.  Mobile telephone networks increasingly provide the communications infrastructure that has largely been lacking throughout the region.  Yet, governments have generally made only modest allocations of bandwidth available to Latin American wireless operators, either absolutely (in terms of spectrum each country could allocate at modest opportunity cost) or relative to countries in North America, Asia and the European Union.  Using an empirical model estimated on mobile phone data for international markets, we show that very large social benefits are available to countries that make more spectrum available for mobile phone markets. We conduct simulations using our calibrated model to provide lower bounds for country-by-country gains from larger allocations. We also discuss the impact of alternative regulatory regimes on the feasibility to achieve those social gains.

INTRODUCTION Wireless services are growing rapidly.  In Latin America, as in other developing markets, mobile phone networks are supplying valuable social overhead capital (SOC), stimulating economic growth.  Waverman et al. (2005, p. 18), studying African economies, find that "[d]ifferences in the penetration and diffusion of mobile telephony certainly appear to explain some of the differences in growth rates between developing countries ...  there are also increasing returns to the endowment of telecoms capital (as measured by the telecoms penetration rate) ...  Our analysis suggests the need for regulatory policies that favour competition and encourage the speediest rollout of mobile telephony."   This conclusion builds on the widespread view that telecommunications networks are key components of SOC (Hardy, 1980; Leff, 1984; Norton, 1992; Greenstein and Spiller, 1996), and recent studies showing that wireless technologies are strong drivers of developing country growth. Yet, spectrum policies in Latin America are, on the whole, extremely conservative.  This appraisal reflects both the structure of regulation, and the quantitative outcome.  On average, Latin American countries allocate only about 100 MHz to mobile phone carriers' licenses, compared with a mean of about 266 MHz in the European Union.   Some of the differential is attributable to demand differences, but controlling for those factors we still find a statistically significant restriction on valuable bandwidth imposed across both sets of markets.  Given substantial amounts of unutilized bandwidth, the opportunity costs of more generous cellular allocations are typically quite modest. Two Latin American countries, Guatemala and El Salvador, liberalized their spectrum regimes via far-reaching legislative measures enacted in 1996 and 1997, respectively.   Wireless markets in both countries appear relatively robust, exhibiting high degrees of competitiveness, as measured by industry concentration and retail prices.    Other Latin American countries, while not undertaking such ambitious reforms, have initiated policies that distinguish heir wireless markets.  These include Argentina, Chile, Nicaragua and Paraguay.  The experience of these nations may inform policy makers as to what might be achieved, and offers data for public choice scholars wishing to explain the divergence in regulatory regimes - a pursuit we do not undertake herein. The primary task of this paper is to evaluate the Latin American spectrum policies now in place, an analysis we divide into four parts (Sec. 2 - Sec. 5).  First, in Sec. 2, we provide a diagnostic analysis revealing the primary spectrum under-allocation problem confronting Latin American mobile services markets. We also define alternative regulatory regimes, providing a taxonomy for reform measures that alter bandwidth allocations by traditional administrative actions versus policy liberalization granting wireless rights-holders greater scope for accessing and utilizing airwaves.  In Sec. 3 we then present a model that tracks the relationship between spectrum policies and retail mobile market results (prices and outputs), empirically calibrating the model using a panel consisting of 28 countries for the period 1Q1999-2Q2003.  These estimates are then, in Sec. 4, used in simulations that forecast the social value of enhanced spectrum allocations for mobile phone service in six of the largest Latin American nations. We find that, in response to an increase of 20 MHz, the average change in consumer surplus in our sample is approximately US$50 per capita.  This magnitude is over 10 times the average marginal revenue in regional countries employing wireless license auctions (on a per capita per MHz basis), suggesting that the social gains are of very substantial magnitude, and accrue overwhelmingly to consumers' surplus rather than to mobile operator profits. In Sec. 5 we consider the prospects for achieving such welfare gains under alternative regulatory structures. The gains described above could be realized via policies instituted by fiat under the administrative allocation systems now in place. Alternatively, statutory reforms may eliminate regulatory discretion, forcing a regime shift.  We also explain that the important link between a liberalization of licensee property rights (granting greater degrees of freedom in utilizing allocated bandwidth) and the expansion of spectrum allocations (increasing the bandwidth allocated for use by mobile operators).  We then offer a brief conclusion. 2. WIRELESS MARKETS IN LATIN AMERICA: A DIAGNOSIS Spectrum allocation policies in Latin America are usefully evaluated with respect to the market for mobile phone services.   First, this application constitutes the dominant spectrum-based service in terms of service revenues.  Second, the next most economically important industry, radio and television broadcasting, is intensely political and is subject to its own idiosyncratic analysis.   Third, mobile telephony plays a vital role in economic development, providing basic telecommunications infrastructure for most residents and businesses.  And fourth, this industry is broadly studied by investors, yielding data and opening the way for empirical estimates of the social value of policy reforms. The average amount of spectrum allocated to cellular service in Latin American countries (equally weighted) is 102 MHz (see Table 1), well below the average in the European Union of 266 MHz. We consider two possible reasons for this gap. A market hypothesis: In Latin America the demand for mobile services does not justify a higher allocation.  The lower amount of spectrum would optimize resource use were marginal frequencies more productively deployed elsewhere. A regulatory hypothesis: Regulatory authorities in the region have inefficiently constrained spectrum access, over-conserving bandwidth.   This would suggest non-market failure. Figure 1 illustrates the situation for a sampling of countries included in quarterly mobile phone market data published by Merrill Lynch (2003).   This global dataset includes six Latin American countries:  Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia.  As can be seen, all six countries allocate substantially less spectrum to mobile telephony than what is predicted by their per capita national income.  This L.A. sub-sample features the largest economies in the region, and we note that most of the remaining countries have even more parsimonious spectrum allotments. The quantity of spectrum allocated to wireless phone service is presumably a function of other factors in addition to GDP per capita, and countries throughout Latin America should be included in the analysis if we are attempting to provide a regional perspective.  For this broader statistical inquiry, we generate a new database, adding all non-Caribbean Latin American countries not appearing in Merrill Lynch (2003).  Data for the additional Latin American countries  are only available annually, however.  Hence the new database is an annual panel from 1999 to 2002, with data for 40 countries (29 in Merrill Lynch, to which we add eleven more Latin American countries). Figure 1:  Spectrum vs. GDP per Capita (second quarter 2003) Sources:  Authors' calculations, country regulatory authority websites, and Merrill Lynch (2003). Table 1: Basic Statistics for Mobile Phone Markets in Latin America Note : Penetration is defined as phone subscribers per 100 population. This expanded database permits estimation of a simple regression where the quantity of spectrum assigned to mobile telephony is the dependent variable.  The vector of independent variables includes Population, Population Density, GDP per capita , a Not Calling Party Pays dummy (=1 if mobile phone calls received incur connection charges), a Liberal dummy (=1 if country is Australia, New Zealand, Guatemala or El Salvador ) and an Auction dummy (=1 if country assigns licenses by competitive bidding). Table 2 contains regression results excluding and including a Latin America dummy (=1 if country is in Latin America). Here the coefficients of interest are those associated with the Latin America and the Liberal dummies.  The first is estimated to be negative and of a statistically significant magnitude.  These estimates are similar in both models, one a completely pooled regression, the other using random effects.  Moreover, the Latin America dummy improves model specification.  Controlling for other factors, cellular spectrum allocations appear substantially lower in Latin America -by an estimated 55 MHz -- than in other countries.   This magnitude is over 50% of the Latin American mobile allocation mean. Alternatively, the estimated coefficient for the Liberal dummy is positive, consistent with the goal of economic reform, although the result is not statistically significant. The data reveal a reduced level of spectrum availability for mobile services in Latin American countries versus other markets.  Can this difference be explained by valuable alternative deployments?  In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that any wireless services - in broadcasting, satellite, local area networking or elsewhere -- productively employs the frequency spaces withheld from mobile operators.  This suggests that the unallocated spectrum has little or no social opportunity cost.  Hence, the data are best interpreted consistent with Hypothesis 2: regulatory constraints limit access to bandwidth.  We now turn to ways in which regulatory structure may impact spectrum allocations. Table 2: Regression Results. Dependent variable: Bandwidth Allocated to Mobile Phone Service (MHz).

Spectrum Regimes: Three Simple Benchmark Models The goal of this subsection is to provide three benchmark models representing the most commonly used spectrum policy regimes in Latin America. Suppose that there exist just two firms and two services in the industry. We will identify the firms with super indexes and the services with sub indexes. We assume that firm i solves: Analogously, firm j solves for .  Distinct cost functions result from differing regulatory schemes. The following models are introduced as benchmarks to discuss spectrum policies found in Latin America.   While simple, the models reflect an important economic reality.  In their use of radio spectrum, wireless networks view the resource as an input.  The value of this input can be increased either by expanding the amount of bandwidth available to carriers (MHz), or by improving the terms on which an existing frequency allotment is utilized.  For instance, suppose a regime allocates each mobile operator's license 50 MHz of radio spectrum, while mandating that analog technology be used.  Regulators could then effectively increase the spectrum allocation either by adding, say, 25 MHz to each license, or by a reform that permitted operators to employ other technologies (including digital systems).  In essence, a liberalization that effectively yields increasing output is analogous to an increase is allocated bandwidth. Model I: Spectrum Assigned to Services In this case, the regulatory authority assigns spectrum to each operator to provide a specific service, with licenses awarded by either beauty contest or competitive bidding. The problem of minimization of costs  for firm i is then given by: , s.t. The two first constraints are the production functions for services 1 and 2. For simplicity, we assume that there are just two factors, capital ( K ) and spectrum ( S ). The capital cost is given by r , while spectrum rights is acquired by firm i at cost .   The last constraint is determined by regulation. A quantity of MHz is allocated to the license of firm i , which authorizes the firm to supply service 1. Service 2 is not authorized by the license, although the licensee, if unconstrained, could provide the service with some fraction of the capacity provided by . The constraints for firm j are a mirror image of those of firm i , and total allocated spectrum is divided between the two licenses: . Mirroring firm i , firm j is authorized to provide service 2 but not service 1.  As a result, each firm enjoys monopoly power in its authorized output market, yet rents are partially, if not fully, extracted through in the license award. Model II: Spectrum Assigned to Firms This case represents an intermediate position on a spectrum liberalization continuum.  The regulatory authority allocates spectrum to licenses, which are then distributed to firms (through auctions or beauty contests), and it does not constrain the services that firms may supply or the technologies employed in accessing this bandwidth.  Cost minimization for firm i is then given by: , s.t. The result is distinguished from that of the previous model due to the altered regulatory constraint. In this case, a total amount of MHz is allotted firm i 's license, with the firm being authorized to freely distribute bandwidth between the two services.   Under this scenario, both firms compete in both markets. Increased spectrum flexibility has two effects. First, firm i is able to deploy frequency space where it produces the greatest incremental profit, increasing the potential value of the license. Second, as firm j also receives the same flexibility, monopoly rents are dissipated, decreasing the value of the license. As a result, the sign of license value windfalls associated with a shift from Model I to Model II is theoretically ambiguous. Model III: Spectrum Assigned by Markets In this case, private property rights are assigned to the spectrum resource, wireless firms enjoying full flexibility in the use of assigned airwave space. Distinct from Model II, spectrum rights can flow between firms.   The cost minimization problem for firm i becomes: , s.t. Distinct from the previous models, the objective function here includes a market price for spectrum ( ), which results from the equilibrium between supply, , and demand in the factor market.  In this case spectrum flows not only to the more efficient use intra-firm (as in Model II), but also to the more efficient firms.  Rent extraction, represented by , continues within the assignment process, with a theoretically ambiguous sign for license value windfalls associated with a shift from Model II to Model III.  In addition, it is theoretically possible that a price increase obtains from Model II to Model III, because in the latter the cost of Spectrum is included as a marginal cost. The sign of both ambiguous effects needs to be studied. Hazlett (2008b) finds that, for countries implementing ambitious spectrum liberalizations, wireless license sales prices are observed to be about 61% lower than in other countries, adjusting for other factors.   This implies that the effect of increasing competition in the transition from Model I through III can easily dominate the higher valuation for flexibility.  This creates a dichotomous policy choice.  Governments will tend to prefer Model I if the policy goal is to maximize auction receipts; Model II or III if the objective is to maximize social welfare. Blanco (2005) studied the impact on Consumer Surplus (and then on prices) of the transitions from Model I through III. Assuming Cobb-Douglas production functions in each service, she showed in simple examples that consumer surplus increases significantly more in the transition from Model I to Model II than in the transition from II to III. She recognizes that this result underestimates the impact of property rights because her evaluation does not consider the gains from flexibility in the introduction of new services or new technologies. There are, however, other reasons why the benefits from the transition from Model II to III are underestimated in her study. The total amount of spectrum liberalized is assumed to be the same in Models II and III, which severely truncates potential effects of a liberalization that permits transactions to increase bandwidth. Nevertheless, her study suggests that regulatory inertia may not result from ideological opposition to property rights, per se, because Model II does not require explicit property rights and yet represents a significant social welfare improvement over Model I. Categorizing Latin American Spectrum Regimes Models I, II and III represent benchmarks allowing us to chart the fundamental economic changes associated with spectrum liberalization.  We now ask: How extensive are exclusive spectrum ownership rights in Latin America? We review the spectrum regulatory regimes of each country in the region,  identifying key aspects. A summary is provided in Table 3, where in the last column we classify each country according to Models I to III, based on the characteristics indicated by the variables displayed in other columns.  Of course, our categorization reflects the judgments we make, and may be viewed somewhat differently by other methods.  In the analysis just above and in Table 3 we attempt to be clear about the manner in which our judgment is exercised. When a service license does not permit the introduction of new services by incumbent firms without permission (column (c)), then Model I is implied. The classification is confirmed by the fact that in those countries the license is revoked when the licensee provides an unauthorized service (column (h)). On the other hand, the existence of explicit property rights (column (f)) is a sufficient condition to classify the country as Model III. The information in the rest of the columns was not conclusive, but in aggregate permits a reasonable classification scheme. For instance, when technological neutrality (column (d)) is not supported, then Model III is excluded. A regime where the absence of a positive administrative determination fails to defer to a petitioner's usage request (column (g)) indicates strong regulatory interference in the provision of new services.  In combination with the absence of technological neutrality, this approach classifies Peru as a Model I country. Argentina and El Salvador present challenges in categorizing. Both present relatively flexible regimes, but column (e) suggests that in El Salvador the spectrum can flow more freely across firms than in Argentina, so Model III best applies to the former while Model II to the latter.  We note that columns (a) and (b) are simply descriptive. Column (a) shows that the broadly used regulatory practice of separating service licenses from wireless licenses is not correlated with the flexibility of the spectrum regime. Finally, column (b) reflects the fact that wireless licenses that define permitted services are (definitionally) associated with inflexible rights. Table  3.  Legal Aspects of Licenses in Latin America * Those considered "services of added valued." In most of the Latin American countries a wireless operator needs two licenses, one to authorize the service (usually a 'public service license') and a second one granting spectrum access. The wireless license defines the service(s) to be provided. The cross constraint established in (b) is usually redundant because, as column (c) shows, the licensee usually needs new service licenses to provide services not explicitly authorized. In this paper we take technological neutrality in a broad sense. The regulatory authority in a country is technologically neutral if it does not impose direct constraints over the technology used by providers of a service. A "neutral" authority can, however, impose indirect constraints over technology such as quality of service requirements. Administrative allocation is the traditional regime where regulators, rather than market-based owners, determine spectrum use. In most countries the wireless license does not convey property rights over spectrum. The exception is the case of Guatemala, which grants title to spectrum use rights. When an existing service provider or an entrant applies for a new service license the authority usually has a deadline to answer the request. If the authority does not provide an answer before the deadline is met, then a positive administrative silence means the application is approved. The provision of an unauthorized service by a licensee is usually subject to penalty as severe as license revocation. Based on the information provided in the previous columns, we assigned each country to one of the reference models discussed in the previous section. Table 3 reveals that the dominant regulatory structure assigns spectrum use rights for specific services (Model I). Most countries define standards for operators, restricting technology choices and violating the commonly stated regulatory goal of technological neutrality. Departing from Model I are the regimes found in Argentina and Nicaragua, which we categorize as Model II.   Both countries feature relatively liberal rules with respect to the use of spectrum allocated to a given license, but does not enable firms to freely move spectrum between firms or to move unallocated spectrum into productive use.  Since relatively little spectrum has been allocated to licenses, this is an important constraint.  Guatemala explicitly defines property rights to the use of frequencies ( Titulo de U sufructo de F recuencia) and extends the property regime by granting parties the right to petition for access to unoccupied bandwidth, imposing an obligation on the regulator to issue such rights by competitive bidding.  El Salvador has enacted a functionally similar process, although property rights are not explicitly granted.  Licenses are defined by international spectrum allocation templates, but licensees are granted the freedom to offer other applications within the bandwidth allocated to the license.  Mechanisms are also specified for parties to obtain unassigned licenses from the regulator.  While the regulatory authority is not mandated to issue to such licenses, as in Guatemala, we note the empirical similarity in the mobile markets.  As of 2003, both countries featured four national networks, with carriers using 140 MHz in Guatemala, and 137.9 MHz in El Salvador.   We classify these systems as approximated by Model III. Prices and Market Concentration in Latin America Thus far we have not discussed the impact of spectrum policy on retail prices.  The regimes identified above, however, permit us to identify some correlations between regimes and market behavior in our test market -- mobile phone services. We are particularly interested in two indicators. First, how much spectrum has been made available for mobile phone markets in the different regimes.  Second, how do retail prices differ across regimes? Consider first the spectrum available for wireless telephony in Guatemala and El Salvador. Although in both countries the number is still below the trend line in Figure 1, the gaps -- 16 MHz for Guatemala and 20 MHz for El Salvador - are well below the regional average of 55 MHz.   This suggests that liberal regimes facilitate the efficient flow of spectrum in Latin America. Figure 2 shows that higher spectrum allocations are directly related with lower average price per minute (APM). It is then not surprising that cellular telephone rates appear to be generally below average under the more liberal Latin American spectrum regimes, while competitiveness appears to be higher as it is shown in Figure 3 where we chart the APM and HHI data found in Table 1. Figure 2: Average Price per Minute (APM) and Spectrum Allocations in Latin America Figure 3: Average Price per Minute (APM) and Market Concentration (HHI) in Latin America While we have strong theoretical and empirical reasons for associating high concentration with high prices,  Figure 3 suggests the relationship is complicated. The lowest price is observed in Costa Rica where the supply of wireless telephony is concentrated in a state monopoly, unique in our sample.  As Blanco (2005) points out, subsidies seem to explain these low prices.  At the other extreme, Venezuela shows one of the highest values for APM, despite of the fact that the concentration index is one of the lowest in the region.  Importantly, however, the countries with the most liberal regimes, El Salvador and Guatemala, feature both relatively low APMs and concentration ratios. Their situation is comparable to Chile and better (from a social point of view) than Brazil, despite differences in size and GDP per capita tending to favor the larger, wealthier markets.  Our hypothesis is that spectrum liberalization drives these results. 3. MODELING THE IMPACT OF SPECTRUM SCARCITY 3.1. A SIMPLE THEORETICAL MODEL Consider a market where N firms will be producing a homogeneous mobile telephone service, with output levels given by q i where i identifies the firm.  We assume there is no initial incumbent.  Aggregate output is given by . The market price associated with this output is defined by the inverse demand function p(Q) . The cost function of firm i is given by: (1) Where K i denotes capital and S i the spectrum allocated to the license awarded to firm i . We assume a two-stage game, where in the first stage capital and spectrum investments are defined simultaneously and independently.  In order to focus the analysis on spectrum allocation policies, we assume symmetric investments ( K i = K for all i ). In the second stage we assume Cournot competition.  Second stage's marginal cost is decreasing in capital and spectrum, and these two inputs are substitutes (Reed, 1992; 11-12, 20-21). In what follows we denote market share as , while is the price elasticity of demand.  In such a context, a Mark Up equation is defined by: In particular, when spectrum allotments are equal across competitive licenses, we obtain: (2) where S is the total amount of spectrum assigned to mobile wireless services. We interpret the equilibrium Mark Up equation (2) as one where the supply depends on the elasticity of demand ( ( Q ), the level of investment ( K ), the total amount of allocated spectrum to the service ( S ), and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index ( HHI ).  We assume demand for wireless telephony to be a function of the price of wireless service ( p ), income level ( Y ), and the price of alternative telephone services ( F ).  In principle, we can posit a constant elasticity of demand function for wireless telephony  such that: (3) 3.2. THE ECONOMETRIC MODEL In Hazlett and Muñoz (2008), we sought to answer the question: Looking across countries, what factors influence the prices and outputs of mobile phone usage? The Latin American country simulations conducted in this paper are enabled by the empirical model developed therein..  The econometric model is a system formed by an empirical Mark Up equation motivated by the variables in Eq. (2), and an expanded log-log version of the demand function given by Eq. (3).  Both include nonlinear terms. Price is predicted by a system of simultaneous equations, one an empirical Mark Up equation (4) and the other an empirical Demand equation (5).  A traditional fixed effects model would permit us to adjust for unobserved characteristics between markets (countries) in our panel dataset.  However, our inclusion of important time-invariant explanatory variables led us to employ a pseudo-fixed effects model (Plümper and Troeger, 2007).  The endogenous determination of RPM, TOTMIN and HHI is embedded in the estimated model, which uses a 3SLS approach in the first and the third stages of the Plümper and Troeger procedure.  Included variables are described in Table 4. Identification is achieved in the estimation of the system because the number of excluded explanatory variables in each equation is greater than the number of endogenous variables. Merrill Lynch data were available for 28 wireless phone markets, providing quarterly information on prices (proxied by mean revenue per minute of use) and output (minutes of use), 1999-I to 2003-II.    Results are displayed in Table 5 for different specifications. Model 6 was the preferred specification, and the one whose results are discussed here.

Significance: * 1%, ** 5%, *** 10%. "R-squared" is a pseudo-R-Squared that can be less than 0.   Source: Hazlett and Muñoz (2008). Regression results show, through the Mark Up equation, a positive relationship between equilibrium prices and HHI and a negative relationship with the amount of spectrum.  The magnitude of either relationship is substantial, leading us to conclude that policy makers should focus on promoting lower retail cellular prices by allocating more radio spectrum (or allowing markets to allocate more radio spectrum), and/or by permitting more liberal use of spectrum already allocated.  The increase in spectrum availability both increases efficiency directly, lowering marginal costs of wireless services, and indirectly, by lowering fixed costs.  The latter facilitates entry by competitors, intensifying price rivalry and reducing HHI .  It also enables the provision of innovative services such as wireless broadband access (Rosston, 2001), although these effects are beyond the scope of our empirical analysis.  This implies, importantly, that the welfare effects produced by more liberal spectrum policies are very conservatively estimated in this study. By obtaining estimates of consumer welfare changes associated with differences in spectrum allocations across countries, the calibrated model can then be deployed to estimate the change in consumer surplus and service revenues in a given market for a hypothetical increase in the amount of spectrum allocated to mobile telephony.  In particular, we perform this exercise in each of the six Latin American countries included in the Merrill Lynch dataset. 4. SIMULATIONS The model's empirical estimates suggest that the amount of allocated spectrum is critical, but also important is the level of industrial concentration, which is heavily influenced by the regulator determining the number of licenses and setting other rules impacting operator size, entry barriers, and competitive rivalry. In this section, we consider choices a regulatory authority makes with respect to the total quantity of spectrum allocated to the mobile telephone sector. 4.1. Direct Effects of Changes in Spectrum on Retail Price Figure 4 illustrates the direct effect of an increase in spectrum on the average revenue per minute ( RPM ) in mobile telephony (including 95% confidence intervals).  The function is obtained with empirical results displayed in Table 5, fixing all the other (non-Spectrum) exogenous variables at their mean sample values and then varying the quantity of spectrum (in MHz) allotted to the mobile telephony sector.  As is seen, price is decreasing in the amount of allocated spectrum, with the rate of decrease declining.  Retail prices are reduced because marginal costs are lower with more abundant inputs and because additional spectrum generally accommodates more intense competition, reducing HHI. To simulate the direct effect of a spectrum allocation shift in a particular country, the Spectrum-Price relationship in Figure 4 changes due to particular characteristics of that country (which differ from the sample mean).  We are able to make these adjustments for each of the six Latin American countries in the quarterly database, and present them as six panels of Figure 5.   We observe that, while the opportunity for consumer welfare gains is available across all countries, the magnitude of the gains (via retail price reductions) varies. Figure 4: Retail Price as a Function of Spectrum Allocation: The General Case 4.2. Country Pricing Simulations The country simulations ask the question: If regulators were to make more spectrum available to mobile telephone networks, where would retail prices ( RPM ) be? The results suggest that, starting from the current situation, Venezuela has the potential to reach one of the lowest retail prices (for countries in the sample), with revenue per minute falling around US$0.085, while Argentina is (lower) bounded at about US$0.15. The sources of these differences are in the country specific mean values for the other explanatory variables, and differences in institutional aspects captured in the fixed effects constants. The result is not surprising because the most constrained the current state, the higher the marginal benefits from reallocations. Figure 5: Price as a Function of Spectrum Allocation: Six Latin American Markets Argentina					Brazil Chile						Colombia Mexico					Venezuela 4.3. Country Welfare Analysis To evaluate the impact of spectrum-policy induced price changes in economic welfare terms, we used the model reported in Table 5.  Simulations were performed in 1000 groups of 1000 cases each, with shocks to the system of equations from a Bivariate Normal distribution with mean zero for each dimension.  The variance-covariance matrix was estimated from the residuals of the Stage 3 regressions contained in Appendix 2 of Hazlett and Muñoz (2008), which provides detailed explanation of the procedure. These experiments were conducted at least a hundred of times each to achieve convergence. Results for the six Latin American countries are displayed in Figure 6. Potential gains partly depend on the size of the market, so it is unsurprising that the most populous countries, Brazil and Mexico, are predicted to have the highest incremental consumer surplus. Other results, however, are more interesting.  For instance, additional bandwidth generates approximately as high an increase in consumer surplus in Venezuela as in Argentina, despite the Venezuelan economy's smaller size (see Table 1).  This outcome appears to be driven by the extremely parsimonious spectrum allocation for mobile telephony in Venezuela (57 MHz). It is noteworthy that, across countries, revenues increase slowly when more spectrum is made available to operators. Given that the change in producer surplus is even lower than the change in revenues, more spectrum can reduce the aggregate sum of operators' benefits. However, even when total benefits increase, it is possible that more spectrum leads to more players, so incumbents' benefits decline.  This may help explain why governments are so conservative.  Concerns regarding lower revenue extraction (in license auction regimes) or in protecting profits of wireless incumbents would tend to bias regulation away from welfare maximization. Finally, welfare changes follow a linear path rather than one of diminishing marginal returns due to a condition of the selected model, wherein elasticity of demand is assumed constant. Alternatively, in Model 1 of Table 5 the elasticity of demand declines (in absolute value) as more spectrum is made available to the market, generating a nonlinear impact on welfare.  The intuition is explained by the fact that, beyond some level of output, the demand elasticity falls to below unity, creating a situation where further increases in MHz would reduce market revenues. FIGURE 6: CHANGE IN CONSUMER SURPLUS AND REVENUES: THE EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM ALLOCATIONS 5. POLICY IMPLICATIONS As shown, many Latin American countries could capture substantial social gains by expanding the bandwidth available to supply mobile phone services.  Such enhancements would improve voice services, broadband services, and broadly boost economic development (see, e.g., Jensen 2007).  Policies to achieve such changes can be implemented only by overturning existing political equilibria.  What strategies may affect such movement is not the subject of discussion here.  Rather, we tackle the more general topic of how more generous spectrum allocations may be structurally accommodated. 5.1. SPECTRUM ALLOCATION REFORM There are two primary sets of institutional reforms that effectively make additional bandwidth available to mobile markets.  The first entails a broadening of the spectrum use rights granted in the traditional license.  In the limit, this produces a private property right to allocated spectrum, what has been called a Liberal License (Hazlett, 2008a) or EAFUS, exclusively assigned, flexible use spectrum (Hazlett and Spitzer, 2006).    This approach leaves in place the underlying spectrum allocation structure, meaning that EAFUS rights are granted case-by-case.   Such policy changes are sometimes associated with rules for "secondary markets," where regulators may permit licensees to not only trade rights explicitly granted but to enjoy flexible use of the spectrum allocated to the license. This liberalization of license terms facilitates the market allocation of frequencies anticipated by Coase (1959).  Licensees become de facto owners of spectrum, and then seek to deploy bandwidth to maximize value. License rigidities, constituting both competitive and technological barriers to entry, are removed.  While bandwidth remains limited to the frequency space allocated to liberal licenses, greater flexibility allows for enhanced efficiencies (optimizing input combinations with greater degrees of freedom).  This drives productive expansion of wireless services. The alternative reform is for government to simply allocate more radio spectrum to mobile network licenses.  Under any given set of rules, such increases lower the opportunity cost of spectrum inputs and increasing output, ceteris paribus. Of course, liberalizing both licenses and spectrum allocations can be undertaken in tandem, and many reform efforts have taken this approach.  One particularly articulate proposal in this direction is the FCC staff Working Paper by economist Evan Kwerel and engineer John Williams (2002).  In their "Big Bang" proposal they advocate increasing the spectrum (under 3 GHz) allocated to liberal licenses from about 180 MHz to 438 MHz, being careful to note that the licenses would be most efficiently utilized under "flexible use" rules. 5.2. REFORM WITHIN EXISTING REGULATORY STRUCTURES Kwerel and Williams (2002) focus on regulatory agency policy making in the U.S. rather than appealing to Congress for statutory reform.  This approach has produced some results, as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission broadened the spectrum use rights conveyed in mobile network licenses through the cellular (1980s) and PCS (1990s) assignments.   While relatively little bandwidth was made available prior to 2006 (Bazelon, 2006; Faulhaber, 2006),  despite the argument made in Kwerel and Williams (2002) and the high social values associated with incremental allocations (Hazlett and Muñoz, 2008), the movement towards a spectrum market was facilitated via agency liberalization. A more ambitious reform program was announced by Ofcom, the wireless regulatory authority in the United Kingdom, in 2004.  By 2010, the Ofcom plan aims to remove restrictions on license use for 72% of the bandwidth in the most valuable frequencies, between 300 MHz and 3 GHz.   This strategy relies on loosening constraints embedded in licenses, and to expand the frequency space allocated to assigned licenses.  It follows the strategy of exhaustive licensing, which we deem a "Model II" approach, where the only spectrum not assigned to liberal licenses is withheld by specific justification.  This is the mirror image of the standard approach, which issues (rather than retains) license rights only when specific justifications are found to be in the "public interest." 5.3. REFORMS REQUIRING STRUCTURAL CHANGES The alternative path to enabling market allocation of radio spectrum entails structural reform of the spectrum allocation process.  While the barriers to such institutional change are considerable, the interesting fact is that two Latin American economies succeeded in spectrum liberalization via national statutes just over a decade ago.  In 1996, Guatemala created explicit private property rights to radio spectrum, t itulo de usufructo de frecuencia (TUFs), a "Model III" approach.  Such devices define ownership by specifying: a.  the band or frequency ranges; b.  hours of operation; c.  geographical coverage area; d.  maximum effective radiated power by the TUF holder; e.  maximum field strength or signal strength on the border of the coverage area; f.  order and title number; g.  issue date and expiration; h.  name of title holder; i.   blank spaces for endorsement of reassignment to another party. Any person or entity is entitled to request a frequency, triggering the TUF assignment process.   The independent regulator is constrained to issue requested, non-conflicting rights and to keep an up to date record of TUF holders.  Petitions are subject to opposition on the grounds of radio interference with existing services, but strict time limits for adjudication, as well as binding arbitration mandates, are designed to block excessive administrative barriers to entry.   Rights to contested TUFs (with multiple claimants) are required to be assigned via auction.  TUFs carry 15-year terms, with an additional 15 years at the option of the TUF holder.  According to the International Telecommunications Union, Guatemala has "probably the world's most liberal radio spectrum regulatory model." El Salvador arrived at a similar policy outcome via less radical means in a 1997 statute.   Concessions for the use of frequencies extend for a 20-year period, and can be transferred or subdivided in frequency, geographic, and time dimensions without regulatory approval.   Rights holders are free to choose technologies.  While a National Table of Frequency Allocation (TFA) describes the type of services frequencies are allocated for,  rights holders may deviate from TFA specifications without penalty.  This results in generic license flexibility.   Additionally, the regulator is directed, as in Guatemala, to issue requested licenses, using auctions for contested applications.  To the extent these rules are administratively or legally enforced, they can be said to enable a market in radio spectrum (Hazlett et al., 2007).  These idiosyncratic spectrum policies illuminate possible paths to liberalization, an important normative exercise left for later research. 6. CONCLUSION Most Latin American countries appear to inefficiently constrain access to radio spectrum.  In a model calibrated via cross-country differentials in frequency allocations and retail mobile phone rates, we find substantial social gains available from removing such limits.  Policy reform, which entails an expansion of administrative allocations or more general liberalization measures, can be pursued either by independent regulatory actions or via statute. Regulators in Chile and Paraguay have administratively made relatively generous bandwidth available for mobile phone use. Guatemala and El Salvador, enacting statutory reforms in the 1990s, more fundamentally liberalized their regimes.  Networks in both countries utilize relatively abundant bandwidth under rules allowing discretion in the deployment of services and technologies.  Such policies accommodate productive use of radio spectrum, lowering mobile phone rates and increasing consumer welfare.  Yet, our simulations for six of the largest Latin American markets suggest that the social value of increasing mobile spectrum allocations is still high -- on average, US$53.70 per capita for an increment of 20 MHz.  Since there are no competing economic employments for such bands, which effectively lie fallow, additional allocations would produce the proverbial "free lunch."  Why public policy makers rarely exploit such opportunities is an excellent question for further analysis. More generally, the relationship between spectrum policy measures and retail market outcomes has been little studied.  Scholars and regulators would benefit from greater visibility over the linkages between policy inputs and economic welfare outputs.  We hope that this research paper might stimulate more interest in this endeavor. 7. REFERENCES Annan, K., 2005.

The most difficult data to identify included Spectrum and Fixprice .  To enable the inclusion of additional country data, Fixprice was adjusted in Canada: The reported values are zero from 1991 to 1994; thereafter it is not reported.  We used an assumed value of "0" after 1994. The case of Sweden was special because Spectrum data was fully available and so it was included in the analysis for Figure 1 and Table 2. However, Fixprice was unavailable and then it was excluded in the analysis of Hazlett and Muñoz (2008).

For the sources, see Table 1 below for Latin America and Appendix 1 for the European Union. This paper uses the terms "wireless telephone," "mobile telephone," and "cellular" interchangeably. The politics of broadcast regulation have figured prominently in explaining the spectrum allocation regime in the U.S. and other countries, but the emerging dominance of cellular in the 1980s and 1990s fundamentally shifted this paradigm.  See Hazlett (1998, 2001). For example, Hazlett et al. (2006) study the transition to digital TV in Europe. Using estimates from the mobile phone market, they provide a lower bound for the social value of TV band spectrum. The Merrill Lynch database consists of a quarterly panel with 46 countries, first quarter 1999 through the second quarter 2003.  A subsample of 29 countries was used given that these were markets for which spectrum allocation data were available. We use a simple linear model in this diagnostic because we are focusing on the relationship between spectrum allocations for mobile telephony (in MHz) and per capita income. The additional 11 countries are found in Table 1, along with the six L.A. nations found in the Merrill Lynch database. These four countries undertook far-reaching statutory spectrum reforms in the 1990s, moving substantially to "property rights" regimes.  See Hazlett (2008b). The data are limited, of course, yielding few degrees of freedom. These models are based on Muñoz (2004). Cost minimization is implied by profit maximization, and is the component of the optimization process directly linked to spectrum policies.  How spectrum inputs are used in the wireless operator's production function, subject to different regulatory constraints, imply cost functions defining the relevant margins. This cost represents the payment offered in the corresponding auction, or the implicit payment (in the form of rent-seeking and commitment to non-economic expenditures) for licenses in a beauty contest. Liberalization of spectrum policy, following Kwerel and Williams (2002), can be broken down into two component parts.  The first encompasses the flexibility given a particular licensee to use the spectrum allocated to its license.  More flexibility cedes additional property rights to wireless operators.  The second encompasses the process whereby spectrum is allocated (or reallocated) from one category to another.  This permits spectrum to be bid out of a given deployment and used in another without special regulatory action. This constraint does not preclude "spectrum sharing" between the two services.  The total capacity of the allocated spectrum, then, can be defined in multiple dimensions. This distribution "between" services may (in fact, likely would) involve sharing frequency spaces.  But splitting capacity between multiple services cannot be done without cost.  Hence, this does not change the basic trade-off we model, for simplicity, as a choice between service-specific bands. This was the logic employed by Coase (1959), who suggested that private property rights in spectrum would not only substitute for government allocation, they would lead to more efficient levels of radio interference. Details of legal documents reviewed are given in Appendix 3. In the following sections we show that, at the current margin, more spectrum allocated to mobile phone markets implies higher social welfare. Of course, the spectrum gap for Latin America would be wider were Guatemala and El Salvador not relatively well endowed. See Hazlett et al. (2007). See Hazlett and Munoz (2008). A more general log formulation would include nonlinear terms. The database in Hazlett and Muñoz (2008) is detailed in Appendix 2. We emphasize that it differs from that used to generate Table 2 primarily due to the fact that quarterly price and output data are not available for most Latin American countries. Note that RPM, obtained as revenues over minutes of use, is not identical to APM, average price per minute posted by wireless operators in their plans.  Either variable is a proxy for price. Out of sample predictions are difficult to obtain due to the use of a pseudo-fixed effects model. The U.S. cellular market could access less than 190 MHz of radio spectrum, about 100 MHz less than other countries of similar income levels.  See Figure 1.
