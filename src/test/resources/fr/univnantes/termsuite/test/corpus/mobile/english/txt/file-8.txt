INTRODUCTION 
 
The basic requirement for meaningful use of any web-based tools is to be able to have hassle-
free access to the internet. Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) can only serve 
as effective tools of broad-based development and opportunity for all if all people in developing 
countries can afford access to them (Khalil, 2003). However, underdeveloped or even complete 
absence of telecommunications infrastructure is hampering use of ICTs in rural remote areas 
(Mandioma et al., 2007; Adomi, 2005; CIPESA, 2005). Broadening the reach and affordability of 
these technologies and services to rural Africa remains a complex and difficult challenge. This is 
because terrestrial telecommunications infrastructure requires substantial investments that are 
often unaffordable for the public sector and don't make economic sense to the private sector 
(Songan, et al., 2004; Chatelain and Van Wyk, 2007; Fibre for Africa, 2007b; Hasson, 2008). Yet 
affordable and reliable internet accessibility in poor rural areas will extend the attendant beneficial 
impacts of ICTs. However, all this will depend on a number of key factors. These include (i) Low-
cost, reliable communications infrastructure being built in rural areas. This goes hand in hand with 
increased awareness of the value-added services brought about by internet connectivity, which 
will in turn create the requisite demand and justify the massive financial and technological 
investment. (ii) A supportive and effective legal and regulatory environment being created and 
maintained, to ensure competitive markets for communication services (iii) Governments 
providing incentives to private sector investment that lead to the expansion of affordable internet 
accessibility to rural areas through a range of pro-active policy, regulatory and investment 
measures, including public-private sector partnerships, where appropriate. The ultimate measure 
of the value and impact of ICTs in development are the desired outcomes that have a bearing on 
the Millennium Development Goals, i.e., reduction in poverty levels, thriving African economies, 
reduced disease, increased literacy, etc.  
 
COST OF INTERNATIONAL BANDWIDTH 
 
Hesselmark (2003) compared cost of surfing the internet in different African countries and 
observed that there was some inter-country variation. Some anecdotal reports maintain that 
internet accessibility for an individual in Africa costs about 300 times compared to that in most 
European countries. Mode of accessing internet largely determines cost of bandwidth. According 
to AfrISPA (2007), the cheapest dedicated one megabyte of bandwidth in Kenya went for 
US$4,000 (KSh280,000), compared to South Africa where one megabyte costs US$300 (KShs 
21,000). This disparity came about because Kenya accesses bandwidth via satellite links, while 
South Africa uses fibre optic cables, indicating that bandwidth via satellite is far more expensive 
than wired bandwidth. Another example comes from Ghana. By 2004, a monthly half circuit 2Mg 
(E1) bandwidth cost between US$4,000 and US$6,000 over satellite while the same bandwidth 
cost US$12,000 over the SAT3 undersea cable which lands in Accra (Oskiakwan, 2007). This is 
even ironic since, as noted above, bandwidth accessed via fibre optic cable should be far 
cheaper than that accessed via satellite.  
 
The situation in Uganda is such that due to high cost of bandwidth, some institutions can only 
afford very low bandwidth. For example, Mbarara University pays US$2190 per month for a 
bandwidth of 384 kbps. This translates into very slow and frustrating internet connectivity, and to 
prevent slowing the system even further, many computers on university campus are not 
connected to the internet.  This seems to be a problem that is common to many African countries 
(Jensen, 2004; Adomi 2005; The Economist, 2007; Fibre for Africa, 2007a). Osiakwan (2007) suggested the existence of a cartel among various satellite operators since, despite liberalisation 
and competition in some African countries, internet connectivity is still expensive. Yet in other 
regions of the world where cut-throat competition is taking place, there has been an explosive 
penetration of mobile telephony and broadband services, thus driving prices down (Frost and 
Sullivan Report, 2008). According to CIPESA (2005), issues related to Internet Governance are 
not the main hindrance to usage of internet in Africa, but rather due to (i) the technology currently 
deployed being expensive (ii) cumbersome and expensive licensing procedures (iii) Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs) profiteering from high charges for their services. Hesselmark (2003) 
shares the same view. In addition, internet costs and accessibility may be dependent in part on 
whether a country is landlocked or has direct access to an international fibre connection 
(undersea cable landing site). The so-called 'monopoly' country (i.e., one with direct access to an 
international fibre connection) sets the price, and other countries have to accept this price or use 
an alternative, which is usually satellite (Fibre for Africa, 2007d, 2007e). As noted above, this is 
still an expensive alternative. 
 
INTERNET VIA SATELLITE 
 
Because the 2G (second generation mobile phones) which depend on GSM (Global Service for 
Mobile) technology could not support Internet very well, other technologies such as Wi-Fi 
(Wireless fidelity), and Wi-Max (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) have come up 
as strong viable alternatives to mobile telephony for accessing and distributing internet on the 
African continent (Odufuwa, 2003). Combined with VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal - a 
small satellite earth station), these technologies have  been used to provide internet connectivity 
to great effect (Hegener, 2002; B-SPAN, 2004; CIPESA, 2005; Mandioma et al., 2007; Aghion, 
2008; Hasson, 2008). Satellites will continue to beat all terrestrial infrastructure, anywhere on 
earth, when it comes to broadcasting Internet files (Hegener, 2002), and they are extremely 
effective in reaching places where volume of traffic would not justify a fibre connection (Fibre for 
Africa, 2007c). Prices for end user hardware are coming down very rapidly, and more user 
friendly ways of billing are reducing prices even further (Hegener, 2003; Jensen, 2004). 
According to Jensen (2006), one way to boost access and usage of internet in Africa is opening 
up markets to allow low-cost wireless and VSAT connections.  
 
Broadband via satellite still remains more expensive compared to 'wired' broadband (through 
fibre optic cable). In addition, accessing internet via satellite still requires deployment of certain 
infrastructure, such as satellite dishes, by the end user. Satellite dishes are sold mainly by 
International Telecom companies, implying that there is some capital flight from the continent 
through this process. Moreover, the satellite dish is the single, most expensive item. This, 
coupled with usually cumbersome licensing procedures, makes satellite connectivity a not very 
attractive option for individual internet access in developing countries. Therefore, I argue that 
mobile telephony devices remain the best option for distributing internet in Africa. 
 
MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE INTERNET 
 
The main underlying factor that led to explosive mobile telephony availability was the failure of 
African government-owned telecommunication companies to provide cheap and efficient 
telephone services, thus failing to satisfy the huge demand for communications' utilities on the 
continent. The process by which Africa embraced the mobile phone was accelerated when 
conditions for fair competition were created while at the same time technology allowed for 
connection of thousands of people at lower costs (CIPESA, 2005). Probably these are some of 
the factors have made mobile telephony in Africa relatively more successful. The phenomenal 
mobile telephony take-up in Africa has surprised even the mobile phone service providers (Kinoti, 
2006).  Thus Africa has got the highest growth rate of mobile phone connections in the world, and 
the mobile phone has become the centre of the continent's connectivity successes (Butler, 2005; 
CIPESA, 2005;). Gerster and Zimmermann (2003) concur, and go on to suggest that a 
combination of mobile telephones and internet would seem to be an 'appropriate technology' for 
Africa, given the high penetration of mobile phones and low internet penetration. Moreover, (Odufuwa, 2003) predicted that poor usability of mobile phones as internet access devices would 
be sorted out once internet merged with, and converged into, mobile devices that supported both 
cellular and WiMAX/Wi-Fi standards.  
 
Mobile technologies tend to have an advantage over other technologies in that they overcome 
most physical infrastructural barriers, this being a crucial factor in rural and remote settings where 
the majority of Africans live. Further more, in developing countries, mobile, nomadic and 
handheld technologies have the capacity to gather, store, deliver and enhance information in 
ways that are quite unique compared to the situation in developed countries (Traxler, 2006). So, 
is it possible to use existing mobile telephony infrastructure for distributing internet in Africa? I 
would say yes. Mobile phones have provided an example of leapfrogging technology, whereby 
emerging technologies have brought internet to the cell phone, thus obviating the need to own a 
Personal Computer (PC) for connecting to the World Wide Web (WWW) (Butler, 2005). Perhaps 
the inherent limitation of the 2G (second generation) mobile phones using GSM technology to 
support broadband internet has been a great hindrance in this regard. But the situation is rapidly 
changing with the evolution of 3G (third generation) mobile phones. 3G networks are 'wide area 
cellular telephone networks' which, due to growing demands in network capacity, were designed 
to incorporate high-speed internet access, among other things. They are able to support wide-
area wireless voice telephony and broadband wireless data transfer, all in a mobile environment. 
Already 4G (fourth generation) technologies, which are likely to incorporate global positioning 
services (GPS), are being developed. The all-wireless broadband era is quickly approaching, and 
4G will eliminate the gap between mobile and fixed broadband (Nortel, 2007).  
 
SOME INFRASTRUCTURAL, POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES HINDERING CHEAP 
INTERNET ACCESS  
 
Regarding infrastructure, routing of local African traffic through international connections 
significantly contributes to high cost of internet connectivity. It is estimated that this phenomenon 
costs Africa about $400 million annually, this cost being largely passed on to the individual 
consumer of internet services (Zuckerman and Osiakwan, 2006). This also represents a major 
capital flight from the continent. Some governments, fearful of losing their control over the 
national telephone network, are still reluctant to completely free their telecommunication services. 
Hence, in some countries, state-owned inefficient telecom companies still maintain monopolies or 
duopolies, thus stifling competition. In absence of fair competition, cost of services and tariffs are 
arbitrarily high, leading to profiteering by these companies in exchange of mediocre services. In 
certain instances, rules and regulations for licensing new ICT ventures are frustratingly slow and 
laborious, leave alone having to work with outdated legislation. Due to corrupt tendencies, some 
regulatory agencies may exhibit poor work ethic, leading to foot-dragging and incompetence. In 
the developing world, some political leadership may prefer to preside over an ignorant population, 
and hence would rather maintain the status-quo. Indeed some African governments regulate 
access to the internet. On the other hand, some politicians, who are not ICT savvy and yet are 
the decision-makers, may never appreciate the apparent connection between ICTs and national 
development.   
 
The proper approach to optimally harnessing ICTs for development and poverty reduction is to 
deploy pro-active, competition-centered, market-friendly regulatory frameworks that support and 
sustain both ICT investment and penetration (InfoDev, 2007). The current trend is for the public 
sector, the private sector and civil society to enter partnership in development of ICT policies 
(Adam et al., 2007, p.4). 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
In the above account, I have mentioned some alternatives for accessing and distributing internet 
reasonably cheaply. These alternatives, i.e., combination of satellite and wireless internet 
solutions, have been advocated for by various authors and, theoretically, they seem to offer a 
quick fix to the teething problems associated with internet access in Africa. However, in my view, they can't offer a near-complete solution as long as they require certain infrastructure, such as a 
satellite dish, and availability of a PC (or other form of computer) in order to hit the WWW. In 
Africa, as indeed may be the case in other parts of the developing world, a sizable section of the 
population owning a computer at individual level will take a few more decades to happen. In any 
case, owning a laptop or a PC in order to access internet would not be necessary if appropriate 
hand-held devices were made available cheaply. One reason why mobile telephony has had a 
phenomenal penetration is fact that the phones have become cheaper and cheaper, to the extent 
that many Africans, given their level of income, are able to purchase one. Obviously there is a 
limit to how low prices can go, but there is no doubt low prices have contributed tremendously to 
the almost ubiquitous mobile phones on the African continent. Satellite and wireless technologies, 
where necessary, should only come in to provide the 'last mile' access to internet, but the final 
end-user accessibility should be provided by a mobile handset. 
 
In conclusion, I argue that if internet accessibility is to match availability of mobile telephony in 
Africa, then the ultimate means of accessing internet should be convenient, appropriate and 
reasonably cheap in the African context. In my view, the mobile computing devices are well 
placed to satisfy these conditions. The convergence of mobile telephony with internet on one and 
the same computing device is a welcome development. All that is required now is to put in place 
policy and regulatory measures that will result in affordable internet accessibility from Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs), and the technology that would lead to production of cheap mobile hand-
held computing gadgets. Literature has got examples of cheap, robust computers designed 
specifically for African conditions, such as the 'One Laptop Per Child' project. I suggest that 
similar cheap, robust mobile hand-held devices be developed to deliver both internet and mobile 
telephony to the African populace.
