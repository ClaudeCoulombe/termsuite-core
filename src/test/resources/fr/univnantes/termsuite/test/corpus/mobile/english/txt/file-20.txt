ABSTRACT⎯We propose a system for mobile-phone fraud individual users. The acquired information allows us to predict 
detection based on a bidirectional artificial neural network (bi- user behavior and compare it in real time with the monitored 
ANN). The key advantage of such a system is the ability to real-life behavior. Previous works on predicting time series
