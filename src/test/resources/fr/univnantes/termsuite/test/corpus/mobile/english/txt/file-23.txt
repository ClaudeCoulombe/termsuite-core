7. Conclusion
2 1.1 Service Level Agreement
1. Service Level Agreement (SLA) - formal agreement 
between two or more entities with the scope to 
- assess service characteristics, 
- responsibilities and 
- priorities of every part.
2. SLA may include compensations for an unreached
level of quality as a economic issue of the contract.
3 1.2 Introduction on QoS and SLA studies
1. ITU-T Rec. E.860 "Framework of a service level agreement" (2002) -
a framework for NGN interconnection studies
2. ETSI Rec. ETR 138 (1997) - 9 QOS measures (incl. ISDN):
- Fault report for access line per year,
- Unsuccessful call ratio, 
- Call set up time, 
- Supply time for initial network connection, 
- Percentage of orders completed on or before the date confirmed or contracted with the customer, 
- Response time for operator service, 
- Availability of card or coin operated public pay phones, 
- Fault repair time, 
- Service restoration.
3. ETSI TIPHON project for IP telephony. "Gold-silver-bronze" approach:
voice packet loss: < .5% for class 1 = gold, 
.5% to 1% for class 2 = silver, 
1% to 2% for class 3 = bronze.

ITU-T: The collective effort of service performance which determine the
degree of satisfaction of a user of the service.

- Dependability

• Availability

• Provider Domain

9 1.8 Service Level Agreement
SLA is a result of negotiation between two entities which shows
• service development
• service access & delivery characteristics
• service monitoring and management and
• service economical perspective
SLA Parts
• QoA - QoS Agreement
- QoA Objectives or Service Level 
Specifications
• TCA Traffic - Conditioning Agreement
• Management and Monitoring
• Reporting and Backup
QoS: ITU-T:  The degree of conformance of the service delivered to a user by a 
provider with an agreement between them.
10 1.9 Service Level Specifications
A SLS is a specific SLA and its SLO's to guarantee quality of
service to the user
• SLS are dependent on 
network environment 
but are independent of 
underlying technology 
and protocols.
• On the other hand, 
SLO's depend on the 
underlying technology, 
protocols and 
implementation 
schemes.
11 1.10 SLA and QoS for Wireless Environments
• QoS Support in the 2.5 and 3rd Generation Networks
• QoS Criteria particular to wireless and mobility
- Accessibility
- Reliability
- Connection time
- Service interruptions or dropout due to scarce network resources
- Network coverage
- Roaming and Hand-Over performance
- Speech quality
- Data transfer rate
- Inter-operability between different domains

15 3.1. How to built the global SLA index
1) We use a linear discriminant function LDF, in other words, a scalar 
product of vectors  and :
Q = W1X1 + W2X2 +   ...  +WnXn
where  W1,  ... , Wn are unknown constants, and choose some threshold 
value a that the decision rule is as follows
decision D1 if Q < a
decision D2 if Q > a
2) For "gold-silver-bronze" standard - any service/network provider can be 
correlated to one of three classes:
Gold level     ("Really Great" - expensive)   if   Q < Q1,
Silver level    ("Darn Good" - not so expensive) if  Q1 < Q < Q2, 
Bronze level  ("Best Effort" - inexpensive)  if  Q2 < Q.

20 5.1 Best Practice: "New York Telephone" Service 
Standards
The Telephone Service Standards of New York Telephone Company (Verizon NY now) 
were adopted by the New York State Public Service Commission in 1973 and 
revised in 1989 and 1991. 
Measurement of service quality in four separate categories: 
1) Maintenance Service, 
2) Dial-Line Service, 
3) Answer Time Performance, and 
4) Installation Service. 
These measurements are categorised into three levels: 
1) Objective levels - the level of service that represents good quality service to consumers. 
2) Weakspot levels to denote a level of service below which immediate analysis and
corrective action may be required.
3) Three or more of five consecutive months of weakspot results are usually considered as a 
surveillance level failure

24 6 Best Practice: LRAIC approach for penalty scheme
Long Run Average Incremental Costs (LRAIC) approach:
1. The interconnection charges reflect the actual production costs (new 
entrant operators should not pay for inefficiency, mis-investments, etc.)
2. New entrant operators will be stimulated to invest in alternative 
networks.
3. To create consensus on the cost level among telecom operators.
The SLA as the common target for LRAIC analysis - the border point between 
bottom-up (new entrant estimate) and top-down (incumbent estimate): the 
higher LRAIC estimates the higher penalties.
25 7 Conclusion
1. UMTS QoS issues  - a challenge for ITC
2. Parlay for SLA control
3. Revisited OPIUM Project as UMTS QoS and SLA Testbed
4. Global QoS index and "Gold-silver-bronze" standard
5. To develop LRAIC approach for penalties
