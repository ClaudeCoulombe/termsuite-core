1.  Introduction 
Wireless advertising is becoming a hot topic in the advertising and marketing community 
due to the fast development of wireless networking technology and the significant 
increase of mobile device users. According to eTForecasts1 and Global Mobile2, in the 
year of 2000, there are 468 million mobile users. This number is much higher than the 
number, 365 million, of Internet users in 2000. The Kelsey Group estimated that the U.S. 
wireless advertising market would be $35 million in 20003. However, Jupiter Media 
Metrix predicted that the market would be 600 million by 20034 while worldwide 
 1 wireless advertising market will be 6.5 billion. Company research like Windwire5 and 
SkyGo6 indicated that permission-based alerts delivered to wireless phones capture the 
attention of consumers, drive responding actions, and build brand awareness. Large 
companies, such as Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, have created a subsidiary to focus on this 
market. 
 
What is wireless advertising? Intuitively, wireless advertising refers to advertising and 
marketing activities that deliver advertisements to mobile devices using wireless network 
and mobile advertising solutions to promote the sales of goods and services, or build 
brand awareness. Wireless advertising creates a new media channel to conduct product 
and business advertising and marketing through mobile devices, such as mobile phone, 
PDA and pocket PC. Besides promoting the sale of goods or service, wireless advertising 
also increases product awareness and disseminating information. As shown in Figure 16, 
currently United State has only 0.9% of the world's wireless Internet users while Asia has 
close to 94% of the world's wireless Internet users. Part of the reason is because the 
Internet infrastructure is well established in U.S., and the Internet-based web access has 
been widely accepted by American.

Figure 1: The World's Wireless Internet Users 
 2 As outlined in Wireless Commerce: Marketing Issues and Possibilities8, wireless devices, 
the platform behind wireless marketing, have three main characteristics over PC's and 
other conventional platforms. 
• Accessible - since a wireless device is becoming a personal device because it is 
handy and portable, and available for use at all time. 
• Personal - it carries the user's identity that can be used to track down to an 
individual, unlike PC computers that only carry a household's identity. 
• "Location Aware" - it is easy to track down where a user's physical location is as 
long as the device is on and connected. This is very critical for conducting a user-
oriented marketing and advertising. 
 
The three characteristics provide unique features that do not exist in traditional and 
current advertising media. Wireless advertisements can be highly targeted, flexible and 
dynamic. The targeted audiences are vast, and they can search information, issue 
inquiries, and make purchases at any mobile location. Some early applications of wireless 
advertising in mobile commerce are local entertainment information, stock quote, dining 
and restaurant reservation, and wireless coupon. 
 
Since wireless advertising is one of hot topics in mobile commerce, people want to know 
more about wireless advertising, including business models, advertisement formats and 
presentation styles, technical issues and solutions, infrastructure systems, and standards. 
Hence, we need a) tutorial papers discussing its basic concepts, issues and general 
methods, b) research projects addressing technical problems and solutions, and c) 
wireless advertising systems providing wireless advertising services. This paper provides 
a tutorial of wireless advertising by discussing the different perspectives of wireless 
advertising, including its needs, characteristics, presentation formats, business and 
technical problems. Moreover, it presents an overview of the existing business models, 
vendors and their products in wireless advertising. Furthermore, this paper reports our 
survey results about the perspective users' view on wireless advertising. 
 
 3 Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses different types of wireless 
advertisements. Section 3 presents the five different types of business models in wireless 
advertising. In Section 4, existing wireless advertising approaches and techniques are 
discussed. Section 5 addresses business and technical issues in wireless advertising. 
Section 6 discusses four major vendors. In Section 7, we report our case study results on 
user perceptions on wireless advertising based on a conducted survey. Finally, our 
conclusion and remarks about future direction are given.

 4 2. Wireless Advertisement 
Various kinds of wireless advertisements can be delivered to different types of mobile 
devices, such as a mobile phone, PDA, or Pocket PC. Unlike traditional and Internet 
advertisements, wireless ads have the limited screen size for display. In this section, we 
present current existing wireless ads from a number of major business vendors in wireless 
advertising. 
• Vindigo's location-based application advertisements

3. Business Models In Wireless Advertising 
A business model is a blueprint for a business that highlights the business strategy about 
how to make revenue by specifying markets, products, customers, and where it is 
positioned in the value chain. In this section, we summarized five different business 
models for wireless advertising. Table 2 shows the comparisons. 
• Voice-subsidized 
This business model has an objective to provide competitive offerings and has no 
intention to generate additional revenue. It allows wireless service providers to 
support wireless Internet services (WSP??) and content using subscriber fees and 
WSP resources only. This business model does not require any wireless ad 
technology. 
 7 • Safe income & no upside revenue model 
The objective of this business model is to subsidize acquisition of premier content to 
elevate quality of wireless Internet offering. As for voice-subsidized business models, 
this business model does not require any wireless ad technology. This business model 
derives revenue not only from the subscriber fees, but also from the content 
providers' placement fees. These placement fees are charged to content providers 
desiring "top deck" placement or general distribution via the WSP's network. It also 
refrains from taking a share of any revenue generated by the content providers as a 
result of their ad distribution over the WSP network. 
• Diversified revenue 
The objective of this business model is to subsidize quality content and subscriber 
fees to increase content quality and create a compelling offering that draws and 
retains subscribers. This model has two ways to generate the revenue. The first is 
from placement fees. The other is by receiving a share of advertising revenues and M-
commerce fees, which are realized by the content and service providers directly using 
the WSP's distribution channel in addition to subsidize subscriptions or the cost of 
acquiring content fees. This business model has the added benefit of increasing 
profitability, with minimal effort by the WSP as media sales. Another advantage of 
this model is that it can subsidize either the cost of acquiring content or the discount 
consumer services fees. The drawback of this model is that it requires WSP to have 
its own wireless ad server or a sanctioned ad server for use by publishers. This server 
has to be able to accurately track the ads served to the WSP subscribers based on 
subscriber profiles or WSP restrictions. 
• Media-dependent, outsource media sales revenue 
The objective of this business model is to subsidize quality content and subscriber 
fees to grow and retain the subscriber base, while generating significant revenue. This 
model generates revenue wholly from a share of all advertising and M-commerce 
revenue generated over the WSP distribution channel. Hence, it requires a greater 
commitment to wireless advertising from WSPs. Media sales for a publisher's content 
is an outsource task, and is largely the responsibility of the publisher. In this scenario, 
WSPs must not only be able to track the ads served over their network to ensure 
 8 proper revenue sharing, but also may opt to control the number and frequency of ads 
served to their wireless consumers based on subscriber profiles or WSP restrictions. 
• Media-dependent, in-house media sales revenue 
The objective of this model is to expand the carrier's business function to include 
media sales, controlling and drawing revenue from the wireless Internet property. 
This model is similar to the media-dependent, outsource media sales model. The only 
difference is that it requires a WSP to create in-house media sales team devoted to 
media sales, processing and services of wireless ads. The business model is fully 
dependent on wireless advertising and m-commerce fees for wireless content 
acquisition and subscriber access. It also requires a complete technology solution to 
support wireless advertising in advertisement creation, management, services, such as 
deliver, and measurement.

 9 4. Existing Approaches and Techniques 
Wireless advertising needs wireless networks, mobile technology and infrastructure, 
systematic marketing and advertising solutions. Here, we discuss the existing approaches 
and technologies supporting wireless advertising. 
 
4.1. Wireless Data Access 
Delivering wireless advertisements needs wireless data access methods, environments, 
and platforms. 
 
 Data Accessibility - There are two different data access methods push and pull. They 
are different because they use different approaches to delivery data to the end users. 
Push data refers to a data access approach in which wireless data are delivered a user's 
mobile device without the user requests. In push data approach, the wireless data is 
sent to mobile devices as a short burst of text. These short text messages, sometimes 
called alerts, are frequently generated and delivered based on a user's profile or current 
location. Pull data refers to a data access approach in which wireless data are delivered 
to users upon their requests. A typical example of pull data is that a user accesses the 
wireless Internet, and receives wireless ads when the user browses a specific page with 
ads. Figure 5 (a) and 5(b) shows the available technology for data accessibility. Table 3 
displays the visual and audio data access technologies in both pull and push 
approaches. 
 Data Environment - Wireless advertising currently supports visual and audio data 
access. Visual data access is frequently used and most popular, it includes text and 
sometime graphic images. Audio data access is the conversion of a text message to an 
audio format. Ideally, wireless advertising could be supported with both visual and 
audio data in the near future. 
 Data Platform - Mobile phones and PDAs are the most commonly used mobile 
devices. They have some drawbacks compared to the traditional PCs, such as smaller 
user interface and screen size, less memory, limited graphic formats and power, and 
slower data transfer rates. These limitations increase the difficulty of wireless 
marketing and advertising in placing advertisements on a wireless platform. Unlike 
 10 online advertising, wireless advertising uses mobile devices as a new advertising 
platform to deliver, display, and track wireless ads whenever they are displayed 
anywhere anytime.

4.2. Enabling Wireless Technologies  
Standard and cost-effective wireless technology is the key to the success of wireless 
advertising. Today, three major wireless technologies are being used worldwide. In 
Japan, I-mode, based on C-HTML, is the most popular wireless technology. In Europe, 
SMS is the popular protocol in the wireless community. In America, up to this time, 
WAP is the popular choice and standard for wireless vendors and service businesses. 
These technologies focused on special groups of users, and require particular mobile 
devices and wireless environments. 
 11 • WAP - Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is an open, global specification that 
empowers mobile users with wireless devices to easily access and interact with 
information and services instantly. WAP technology utilizes the WAP gateway and 
WML/HDML language to translate a mobile web request into a traditional 
HTML/HTTP request that the web server understands and vice versa. WAP plays as a 
bridge between wireless network and Internet. It can be used as an information 
channel between wireless devices and the Internet. 
• SMS - Short Messaging Service (SMS) is a digital cellular network feature. It allows 
users to send short text and numeric messages to and from digital cell phones using 
cell phones and e-mail addresses based on public SMS messaging gateways over the 
Internet. SMS is silent and discreet. This is become important when a silent 
environment is required. Today, SMS applications include stock quotes, sports scores, 
and news that can be delivered to mobile phones at regularly scheduled intervals. 
Currently, there are approximately 16 billion SMS messages sent globally each 
month. The majority of that traffic occurred in Western Europe and Asia. In North 
America, most major cellular phone providers offer either one-way or two-way SMS 
services to their subscribers. With one-way service, a user can receive messages; 
while with two-way service, the user can receive and send messages with a cellular 
phone. 
• I-mode - I-mode provides a predominant wireless Internet service that offers wireless 
web access and e-mail services through mobile phones. It was first introduced in 
Japan by NTT DoCoMo and was patented. As of November 2000, I-mode had an 
estimate of 10 million users roughly represent 60% of world's wireless Internet 
users10. It uses C-HTML-based language and protocol to link wireless devices to 
Internet. In Japan, I-mode users are not charged for the user connection time to a web 
site or service, but they are charged according to the transmitted data volume. This is 
different from typical western web services. 
 
Besides the described technology, there are other technologies that are useful for wireless 
advertising. The first is synching technology, which is a simple and popular method that 
allows PDA users to store or cache the content on their PDA devices. Synching 
 12 technology does not require any wireless service because it only uses a computer system 
and its Internet access to updated the stored information during synchronization time. 
With this technology, wireless advertising service providers can offer downloadable 
wireless ads, such as discount promotions, and coupons using a PDA device. Vindigo 
currently allows its users to obtain up to date information on movies, dining and places to 
visit for most major cities within the United State. 
 
The other technology is Web clipping, which allows users to access the updated contents 
dynamically through applications stored on mobile devices as well as wireless modems. 
Web clipping supports PDA users to access the information content from web sites in a 
tailored format on a palm platform. The displayed content on a PDA is a replica of the 
content from a regular web site with fewer graphics. Unlike a regular web page, a tailored 
page fits well in the limited PDA screen size. 
 
5. Issues and Challenges in Wireless Advertising 
Since wireless advertising is still in its early stage, there is a wide range of issues and 
challenges that need to be look upon before it is widely accepted and used. We categorize 
these issues into two groups: technical and business issues. In this section, we discuss the 
identified issues and challenges in wireless advertising.  
 
5.1. Business Issues 
There are many business issues relating to wireless advertising. Understanding these 
issues helps business people in setting up successful wireless advertising businesses and 
services. In addition, acknowledging these issues at the forefront becomes critical in 
business planning and solution delivery.  Learning the business problems, pioneers in this 
industry may be able to keep a good position in the wireless advertising market. Here we 
summarize some of basic business issues below. 
• Cost - Wireless customers, advertisers, and wireless marketing vendors, and 
advertising service agencies are faced with the cost issue. For customers, the current 
cost of wireless devices and wireless Internet subscription are considered high. IDC 
analyst Kevin Burden said that current wireless access for handholds is "too 
 13 expensive for what you are getting back". For advertising agents, the issue of cost is 
apparent in the high financial requirements of industrial research and technology 
placement. 
• Push vs. pull - As we known, wireless advertisements are delivered the mobile users 
using the Push or Pull approaches. For example, if a consumer's profile shows that he 
(or she) enjoys watching movies, then current movie theater advertisements could be 
pushed to the consumer's mobile device. But, the push ad delivery could be intrusive 
to this customer, and causes an unfavorable effect on the buying habits of the 
consumer. If however, the consumer pulls the information of all the movie theater 
within certain radius from where he (or she) is. Hence, the pull ads are less intrusive 
to the customer than the push ads, but it does carry a higher functional cost, and 
requires more complicated systematic solutions because it is simple to broadcast 
wireless ads without tracking their receptions. 
• High business risk - Wireless marketing is still at the beginning of its growth cycle. 
With a new market comes high uncertainty, which means high business risk and low 
advertising revenue. This financial issue will create low investment research and 
development that will make pioneer of this market to make the required progress to 
success. Without research, company will be faced by a though choice between which 
marketing model should be taken. 
• Ad reception - Another business challenge of wireless advertising is determining 
whether or not a pushed ad was ever received. Questions that arise include, whether 
the mobile devices are on and connected? And whether the pushed ad is delivered to 
the customer side?  On the upside, pushed wireless ads may be less expensive than 
delivered pulled ads. Unlike traditional TV and radio ads that have become socially 
accepted forms of intrusion, wireless ads delivered to personal mobile devices is still 
thought as a form of intrusion.Privacy - When discussing consumer profiling, the 
issue of privacy must be addressed. A law must be made to govern to what ad 
agencies are allowed to request and share. The data, presented by The Yankee group9 
during the WAA meeting, indicated that more than 50% of consumers have privacy 
concerns over carrier's use of their personal profile and location information. 
Additionally, wireless communication is still a very non-secure form of 
 14 communications.Ad pitch - There are several methods that advertising agencies will 
attempt to sell to consumers. One is ad pitch based on wants and needs; this method 
has been there for ages. It has been there in paper coupon, and wired online 
advertising. In wireless advertising, we can also do ad pitch based on consumer 
location. For example, delivery and display a list of all French restaurants within a 
certain range from the current location of a consumer. 
 
5.2. Technical Issues and Challenges 
Except business issues, the pioneers in wireless advertising encountered a number of 
technical problems. Here, they are summarized below. 
• Smaller Screen Size - Given the constraint of the size of mobile devices, the user 
interface of wireless devices is quite limited, and it cannot display information-rich 
content in a useful way. Wireless advertising companies must figure out how to create 
effective advertisements in small screen size. Another problem is the inconsistent 
screen sizes among different types of mobile devices. For example, the screen size of 
mobile phone is much smaller than the size of PDA screens. Advertising agents are 
confronted with this dilemma when they generate and deliver wireless ads. This 
problem cannot be solved easily until some standards are enforced on mobile device 
manufactures, and defined in the wireless advertising community.  
• Inconsistent Formatting - When deciding upon the presentation formats of wireless 
advertisements, vendors must consider what kinds of formats are easily accepted on 
the receiving end. For example, special fonts, colors, picture formats might not be 
displayable on some wireless devices. 
• Slow Download Speeds - As what faced by the wired Internet several years ago, 
wireless Internet is facing the slow download speed due to the limitation of current 
wireless backbone. This issue not only affects the users' acceptance of wireless ads, 
but also reduces advertising performance because users might cancel, delete, or 
ignore a wireless access page due to it's slow download of wireless ads. Several 
technologies, such as 2.5G and 3G, are trying to address this issue, but unfortunately 
until today these technologies are not available yet. Some analysts believe that they 
will become available as early as 2003. 
 15 • Broad Spectrum of Technologies - Powerful players, such as Microsoft, Nokia, and 
Phone.com are lining up to push wireless technologies and solutions in different 
directions. As a result, wireless advertising agents are confronted with the dilemma 
on deciding upon what technology to use. The industry is just now trying to develop 
the means for pushing ads to mobile devices, and to create organizations to regulate 
and standardize the industry. 
• Standardization - Without standardization the industry will become too convoluted 
and cutthroat to sustain itself. For time being, wireless advertising is lack of well-
defined standards and regulations of advertising format, content, payment, and 
transmission protocol. Without well-defined standards and regulations, it is very 
difficult for major players, such as wireless advertising businesses, service providers, 
and solutions vendors, to be successful.

Table 5. A List of Major Players in Wireless Marketing and Advertising 
Vindigo 
According to http://www.vindigo.com, Vindigo is focused on creating the industry's 
leading technology platform for delivering location-based information and services - 
widely considered to be the 'killer apps' of the mobile sector. Vindigo uses the Diversified 
Revenue Model. Its objective is to subsidize quality contents and subscriber fees to 
increase content quality and create a compelling offering that draws and retains 
subscribers. Vindigo is the only mobile content and marketing platform available today 
that has a track record of successful deploying robust location-based services with a 
working advertising model for handheld devices. According to the global consultancy 
Ovum, location based services will deliver $19.5 billion of revenue by 2006. Vindigo is 
at the forefront of this industry. Vindigo's applications for Palm OS® and Pocket PC® 
computers and for BREW® and WAP phones now have over half a million registered 
users. Optimized for both wireless and mobile (i.e. portable but not 'connected') handheld 
devices, Vindigo can help you to find out where to go and what to do in 20 major cities.  
 
Vindigo's technology has been carefully designed to offer sophisticated functionality 
along with an intuitive and pleasing user-interface. Vindigo proprietary client application 
allows users to easily identify their locations within seconds. This method has the added 
benefit of allowing users to search information based on where they will be - in addition 
to their current location - and it avoids the most serious privacy concerns because users 
give the location information. Since many users want to access their favorite features and 
services even when they're not connected, current wireless devices are increasingly 
equipped with caching and built-in memory. The Vindigo client software for PDAs, for 
example, contains a complete mapping database, navigation algorithms, and an intelligent 
 17 ad server. Future successful mobile applications need to offer useful functionality offline, 
understand how users have interacted with the application offline, and reconcile this 
information immediately once users regain their connectivity. Vindigo's next-generation 
client-server architecture has the attempt to meet this challenge by functioning well in 
both real-time wireless and intermittently synchronized environments. 
 
SkyGo 
According to http://www.skygo.com, SkyGo is the wireless marketing pioneer, enabling 
carriers, publishers and advertisers to enhance consumer relationships and generate new 
revenue through wireless marketing and m-commerce. Skygo uses the Media-Dependent, 
outsourced media sales, revenue model. Its objective is to subsidize content and 
subscriber fees to grow and retains the subscriber base, while generating significant 
revenue. SkyGo was founded to cultivate rewarding relationships between marketers and 
mobile consumers via the wireless Internet. To shape the future of wireless marketing, 
SkyGo provides technology, media and consulting to help companies effectively 
communicate with mobile consumers. Today, SkyGo offers the technology platform and

8. Conclusion 
It will be several years before wireless advertising is refined, standardized, and wholly 
accepted by both the advertisers and consumers. During this time challenges that are yet 
unseen will present themselves to the pioneers of this new media communication form. 
As discussed on the technical issue one of the biggest limitations in wireless advertising 
is slow data transfer rates. The 3G technology currently is viewed as the best candidate to 
overcome this problem. Once this transfer rates is overcome several creative technology 
such as wireless streaming, Enhanced message service (EMS), and multi media message 
service (MMS) can be deployed to create a more attractive advertisement. The 
improvement of the transfer rates combine with the platform improvement such as better 
pixel on mobile devices and standardization of protocols, software, and formats, along 
with regulated ethical considerations for consumer privacy will determine the success of 
wireless advertising in the future. 
 
For wireless advertising to be successfully accepted by business and consumers, the 
Wireless Industry needs to resolve its many technical and business issues that are 
plaguing the industry. There are two most important technical issues that the wireless 
industry needs to resolve now. The first is to establish well-defined and acceptable 
standards for wireless advertising. This includes the presentation style, screen size, 
communication protocol, payment, privacy rules, delivery techniques, and performance 
measurement. The other issue is the wireless backbone as well as advertising & 
marketing systems.  A standardized wireless protocol like WAP will make it easier and 
cheaper for business to establish a wireless presence.  A bigger standardize backbone will 
improve customer satisfaction and improve the advertising content that is sent to a 
customer like video streaming.  Customer wouldn't need to wait when downloading their 
email and web content because of bulky advertising being sent over a small backbone. 
 
 23 The major business issues that the wireless Industry needs to resolve is how to deliver 
wireless advertising to the customer. Business experiences with Internet advertising 
cannot be transferred to wireless advertising because of mobile device technology 
limitations and people's personal relationship to their device.  The Industry must 
determine how to give customers the choice of being able to receive or not receive 
advertisements, the control to easily bypass advertising contents, the ability to customize 
or filter the type of advertising that they receive, and the feeling that the advertising is 
beneficial to them. If the wireless industry can work to resolve these issues, wireless 
advertising can become a very successful source of revenue for the industry.
