Abstract. Mobile devices offer the opportunity to play games nearly 
everywhere. Moreover, networked games allow individual players to interact 
with other people and to participate in a larger gaming world, which also 
provides for new business opportunities. Hence, we currently see an increased 
interest from game developers, providers and players in mobile games. 
However, due to the inherent nature of wireless networks, many challenges 
have to be addressed. 3G technology combines two of the world's most 
powerful innovations, wireless communications and the Internet. This paper 
proposes an architecture for multiplayer games in 3G networks. It uses the 
capabilities and functionality provided by the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). 
A prototype implementation demonstrates the feasibility of our approach. 
Introduction 
Until recently, most games where stand-alone applications designed for a single 
player only. This has changed lately, where many games are directed towards a multi-
player scenario where people can interact and compete. Today, most of these 
networked multiplayer games are developed for PCs connected to fixed networks. 
Especially in the early days games had to cope with severe bandwidth limitations, e.g. 
due to narrowband modem links. Nowadays, many computers have access to 
broadband services (e.g. via ADSL). 
Currently, game developers, providers and players get more and more interested in 
games that can be played everywhere. Thus, games must be available on mobile 
devices. Yet, in order to support games on mobile devices some challenges, which are 
due to the nature of wireless networks, have to be overcome. One issue is that in such 
a situation only limited bandwidth will be available. Additionally, because of the 
mobility of devices, locations can change frequently and introduce several according 
problems. 
Various technologies for mobile networking and applications on mobile networks 
have been developed. There is no single mobile network technology that can serve all 
possible needs. Each of these solutions has its optimal place and purpose. 
Communication range, speed, latency, coverage as well as cost determine which 
technical solution should be used. To support games in public and wide-spread areas, a wide-area mobile 
communication system such as a 2G or 3G system provides advantages. Furthermore, 
considering the huge base of end-systems, using such networks is interesting for 
providers and for users as well. Worldwide, the 2G GSM standard is used most often. 
GPRS is an evolution of GSM networks towards packet-switched data services. The 
GPRS speed is about ten times faster than current circuit-switched data services on 
GSM networks. GPRS fully enables mobile Internet functionality by allowing inter-
working with the existing Internet. 
Standards organizations and other related bodies have agreed to co-operate for the 
production of a complete set of globally applicable technical specifications for a 3rd 
Generation Mobile System based on the evolved GSM core networks and the radio 
access technologies supported by 3GPP (Generation Partnership Project [1]) partners. 
The technical specifications will be developed in view of global roaming and 
circulation of terminals. The first release of the 3GPP 3G standard has stabilised, and 
the first 3GPP compliant networks are going into operation. Work is currently 
ongoing for 3GPP Release 6. [2] From 3GPP specifications, a complete solution for 
the support of IP multimedia applications (including voice communications) shall be 
available. The solution consists of terminals, GERAN (GSM EDGE Radio Access 
Network) or UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) radio access 
networks and GPRS evolved core network. [3] UTRAN is a new radio network 
architecture. It provides services with more bandwidth for data and better quality for 
voice as compared to GSM and GPRS. The 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) 
enables a "platform" with capabilities like presence, multimedia conferencing, 
messaging, support for QoS (Quality of Service) for data traffic, etc. 
Wireless LAN (WLAN) is another type of access network supported by the 3GPP 
IMS. WLAN according to the IEEE 802.11 standards family provides bandwidth 
from 2 up to 54 Mbit/s. The actual bandwidth available per device decreases 
proportional to the number of the connected, active devices. 
By use of IMS service capabilities and standards protocols a new QoS for games as 
well as better performance and scalability can be achieved. Complex services can be 
created and integrated into a game; based on simple IMS services such as Instant 
Messaging and/or special services such as a scoring service. The availability of 
information like location, terminal capabilities and presence status can significantly 
ease the development and enhance the features of games. 
In this paper we propose an architecture that enables games both to run on 3G 
networks and to use the capabilities and functionalities of the IMS. The focus is on 
networked, multiplayer games. A prototype implementation shows the feasibility of 
our approach. 
In the next section "A General Game Service" we briefly introduce aspects of 
multiplayer games, depict a general game service, and explain its components. In the 
third section "Architecture for the Integration of Games over the IMS", we motivate 
the choice of the IMS for game services and introduce our game service architecture. 
After the description of our prototype implementation in section 4 "An Example 
Implementation", we conclude the paper in section 5 "Conclusions". Related Work 
It seems that there is no other work directly related with the topic of the paper: an 
architecture for mobile, networked games over the IMS. This paper proposes an 
architecture that enables games to run on 3G networks and at the same time to use the 
capabilities and features of the IMS. Current related work focuses on providing 
powerful mobile devices with different features for mobile games and wireless 
connectivity. Mostly, wireless connectivity for multiplayer games is limited to local 
area networks (e.g. Bluetoth). The architecture described in this paper is not tied to 
any game specific hardware. Also we took the approach to base the architecture on 
standardized components and interfaces. 
The remainder of this section lists some commercial game platforms that allow for 
wireless networked games. 
Nokia 0[4] has entered the mobile game arena with its N-Gage in September 2003. 
The Nokia N-Gage platform was designed for both games devices as well as mobile 
phones. The Nokia N-Gage games deck allows users to play multiplayer games 
connected locally via Bluetooth and/or remotely over mobile networks. The N-Gage 
device is a tri-band GSM 900/1800/1900 mobile phone which has, in addition to the 
large screen (176x208 pixels) supporting 3D-graphic, digital music player MP3, 
stereo FM radio, as well as. 
The Game Park Inc device (GP32) [5] is officially available in Asia and parts of 
America. The device is equipped with USB and memory card slot and has a big 
screen. The GP32 is also equipped with a Radio Frequency Module enabling up to 4 
players playing locally wireless games. 
B'ngo is a mobile phone [6] with handheld functionality providing wireless games 
via Bluetooth. The B'ngo device provides up to 8 players in a single match. 
Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) described its Play Station Portable (PSP) as 
the "21st-century Walkman," showing confidence in the company's upcoming 
product, which utilizes a number of high-end components. In terms of 
communication, the PSP will come equipped with 802.11-standard LAN, IrDA, and 
USB 2.0. 802.11-standard. 7] SCE plans to release the PSP at the end of 2004 in 
Japan. 
Gaming-hardware maker Nintendo, which claims 98 percent of the handheld 
console market with the Game Boy, has had a limited wireless-gaming offering. 
Customers of some Japanese carriers, including NTT DoCoMo, can attach their Game 
Boys to cell phones, which then act as a modem for Web-based play. The Nintendo 
wireless adapter will be launched in Japan during the first half of 2004.  8] 
A General Game Service 
After a brief introduction to aspects of multiplayer games, we describe a general game 
service and explain its components. Aspects of Multiplayer Games 
Multiplayer games allow two or more people to play together or against each other in 
the same game. Networked multiplayer games are playable over a network (e.g. the 
Internet). Since the first video game for computer (Space war) in 1961 and the first 
multiplayer game in 1969, the multiplayer game world has faced many challenges. 
Despite both the network and hardware limitations, a variety of multiplayer games 
were produced. The communication range, speed, network coverage, bandwidth and 
latency, as well as parameters of the game client devices (processor, memory, 
graphics, etc.) have an influence on what kinds of multiplayer games can be 
developed. These technical issues can have a significant impact on the applicable 
techniques for specific types of games. 
Independent of the type of network that connects the players with the game, the 
physical limitation of the network cannot be ignored. Important limitations are the 
scarcity of resources, interferences, etc. on the radio link, leading to small bandwidth 
and high latency. Several communication models and design technologies deal with 
these limitations. 
The communication model can be Peer-to-Peer, Client-Server based, or Hybrid. [9, 
10, 11]  In the Peer-to-Peer model the game clients communicate directly with each 
other. In the Client-Server based model a game server is involved in all game-related 
communication. The game server also keeps the complete game state. In the Hybrid 
model a part of the game is implemented with the Client-Server model, especially the 
communication of the game clients with the server, and the remaining part with the 
Peer-to-Peer model. Table 1 shows the possible usage for the different 
communication models.

Figure 1. Components in a General Game Service 
The central component in the Game Service is the Gaming Service that is a server-
side platform providing network connectivity and general support for gaming. A 
Game Provider is a human, an organization, or a collection of humans and/or 
organizations that own a game application, or have the right to use and publish a 
game application (e.g. Tetris, Quake, Age Of Empires). The Game Provider publishes 
and distributes games via the Gaming Service.  
Potential game players must install the game client(s) in their terminals. For mobile 
terminals, for example, this could be done with Over-the-Air provisioning. [12] An 
authenticated and authorized player can either join a (running) game of his choice or 
create a new game session. A game session is a single gathering of players to 
participate in an instance of a game. A game session lasts for some period of time.  
The Community Service consists of different services that enable the players to 
communicate. Examples for Community Services are: Instant/Voice/Multimedia 
Messaging, Chat or Conferencing. One or more of these services may be integrated in 
a game and the player has the choice to use, join or leave them without having to 
interrupt the game. 
The Game Information Service contains functionalities for the management of 
game related information. It may contain the information as listed in Table 2. 
For the management, collection and distribution of game information the Gaming 
Service may use a Presence Service. Game presence information is a set of attributes 
characterizing the current status of a game such as score(s), player(s) and team(s), 
competition information, etc. The Game Information Service manipulates game 
presence information. Players and watchers of games can subscribe to all or parts of 
this information and may also be notified of any changes. Game watchers are users 
that do not (yet) actively participate in a game, but are interested in obtaining game 
related information and/or using game community services.

Architecture for the Integration of Games over the IMS 
In this section we will briefly motivate the choice of 3GPP IMS for game services and 
introduce our game service architecture. 
Why Games over 3GPP IMS 
3G combines two of the world's most powerful innovations, the internet and wireless 
communications. Having access to the Internet in mobile devices will be of great 
value to many users. 
The 3GPP IMS is a standardized infrastructure, able to run services of all 
categories while allowing ease of inter-working between (mobile) operators. [13] It 
will allow: 
 
 Peer to peer, real-time and non-real-time services delivered over the packet 
switched domain 
 
 Seamlessly combined services with different QoS categories 
 
 Only one infrastructure is required for the support all types of services, keeping 
operators' CAPEX and OPEX low. 
From a technical point of view, the IMS provides a horizontal approach to 
integrated, real-time, multiparty services for mobile networks. The Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP) was chosen as the signalling protocol. It allows determining 
capabilities of user terminals, to negotiate QoS parameters, and to use and switch 
between media components as needed. The first release of 3GPP architecture, Release 99 (R'99), defines the basic 
architecture of the network. R'99 was designed to be backward compatible with the 
existing GSM circuit switched infrastructure. The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is 
not part of this and the following release. The so-called Phase 1 IMS is specified in 
3GPP Release 5 and contains the basic mechanisms for multimedia session 
management. The 3GPP Release 6 adds many new capabilities to the system and the 
IMS. Examples are: Presence, Conferencing, Messaging, WLAN-Interworking, and 
Group Management. 
The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is an extension of the 3GPP packet-switched 
core network. It uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to setup, maintain and 
terminate voice and multimedia sessions. The 3GPP packet-switched core network is 
used to support the multimedia session bearer (data path) while hiding the terminal 
moves. 
IMS Game Service Architecture 
The IMS game service architecture was designed specifically for games based on the 
Client-Server communication model. Such games can be integrated with minimal 
effort. Peer-to-Peer or Hybrid games can also profit from some functions of the 
architecture.  
Figure 2 illustrates the IMS game service architecture. The central component is 
the Game Focus. It maintains a SIP signalling relationship with each player in the 
game. Via IMS interfaces towards application servers the Focus can obtain the user 
location and his terminal capabilities, as well as authentication information accessing 
the 3GPP core networks HSS (Home Subscriber Server).

Figure 2. Game Service over the IMS and Using IMS Capabilities and 
Functionalities The game platform API is used for the information exchange between the focus 
and the respective Game Servers. This API is used to communicate the availability of 
game servers, accepted players, game sessions, etc. The game platform API is based 
on OMA Games Services version 1.0 (i.e. MGIF). [14] 
The Focus serves the user's request, and forwards it to the "Service logic and 
policies" component. The game policy can be thought of as a database that contains 
policy information about how the focus should operate and may also contain player 
authorization information. It is the responsibility of the focus to enforce those 
policies. The focus also must both know about and eventually react to policy changes. 
Such changes might result, for example, in the termination of a dialog with a player 
by a sending SIP BYE message. Most policy changes will require a notification to 
subscriber(s) via the game notification service. 
The Proxy component is needed when, e.g., a player wants to join a game's chat 
session. Thus the chat can be tightly integrated with the game, and the players need 
not to know/learn extra information (e.g. SIP-URI) about the chat service. In that 
case, the game service may also check the authorization. 
The Presence User Agent (PUA) component is needed to inter-work with the IMS 
Presence Service for game and player related presence information. The IETF 
SIMPLE protocol is used to publish and obtain presence information. [15, 016] 
The game client (devices) and the game focus manage game sessions with the help 
of the SIP protocol. [017] SIP is also the signalling protocol in the IMS, thus the 
exploitation of the full IMS capabilities is possible. The session signalling also 
includes information needed for the provisioning of QoS for the game data traffic. 
The IMS provides the game client with an authorization token that can be used to do 
network reservations for the games data path. The games data path is set up directly 
with the games server. All game servers in this architecture will accept only data 
connections to game clients, which have been accepted previously via SIP signalling 
with the focus. 
An Example Implementation 
We implemented a prototype of the architecture described in the previous section (see 
also Figure 3). For our architecture two games were integrated: TetriNet and GNU 
VolleyBall. TetriNet was tested over GPRS as well as WLAN networks. TetriNet was 
playable over both types of networks. Because VolleyBall has most stringent 
requirements in regards to delay, the game was playable over WLAN, but not over the 
current GPRS network. In the GPRS network a delay is about one second was 
experienced. For our implementation we used NIST SIP stack implementation, which 
required Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 1.2.  Due to restrictions of the JVM on the 
PDA, we had to modify the SIP stack to run on JVM 1.1. 
 
The original TetriNet is a real-time multiplayer game and supports up to 6 players 
in each game session. For the client device a PDA (HP Ipaq) was chosen. Due to the 
small screen size of the PDA, we limited the number of possible players to 4. Sample 
screenshots of the game client can be seen in Figure 5. TetriNet
SIP Registrar Game Server
 
Figure 3. A Prototype Implementation of the Gaming Service 
The following entities were implemented: 
1. A game client manager and the TetriNet game client on the PDA with the 
Windows PocketPC 2002 operating system. 
A graphical user interface (GUI) manages all games installed in the PDA. XML 
files are used for the configuration. With this GUI the user (player) can register 
himself at the SIP Registrar and join/leave game sessions. Our game client 
manager on the PDA automatically starts the respective game client after the user 
successfully joined a game session. See also Figure 4 and Figure 5Fehler!

2. The Focus of the Gaming Service on a PC running SUSE Linux 8.2. 
This component implements the functionalities of the Focus in the games 
architecture described above. The Focus manages the game sessions via SIP 
signalling with the game clients and with the game servers via the game platform 
API, enforcing the policies of the game provider. 
3. The TetriNet game server on a PC running Windows XP. 
A so-called game agent supports the game server to register at the game focus. 
The game agent may serve all game servers on the host, and is able to trigger the 
initialisation of game servers. 
4. Additionally a SIP proxy and registrar were needed. 
For this server we used the NIST SIP proxy/registrar on a PC running SUSE 
Linux version 8.2. 
In our testbed, the TetriNet game server registers itself in the gaming service. The 
gaming service allocates resources, creates a SIP URI for the game and registers it at 
the SIP Registrar. Several TetriNet game servers may publish game sessions at the 
gaming service at the same time.   
The client software on the IPAQ lists the published game session URIs, and then 
the user selects and joins a game session. Afterwards, the TetriNet game client starts 
automatically. It should be noted that the Focus is only involved with the game session management. The data path for the game is set up directly between the game 
client and the game server.

Conclusions 
In this paper we presented a brief introduction to aspects of mobile multiplayer 
games. We also presented a view of a general game service and explained its 
components. Then we introduced our architecture for games over the 3GPP IMS and 
provided information about our prototype implementation. The prototype implementation of our architecture for Games over the IMS shows 
that games can be integrated relatively easily onto the 3GPP and IMS platform. The 
minimal changes that existing games will have to undergo are to enable them for SIP 
signalling to set up the game session before the data path for the actual game traffic is 
established.  
Besides the porting and deployment of existing games, the presented architecture is 
suitable especially for the development of new games, since different (multimedia) 
services can be integrated and used easily. Overall, the IMS capable to support 
mobile, networked games. Of course, mobile devices may have restricted capabilities 
for running game applications. Such limitations cannot be solved completely by the 
IMS but it can help to overcome critical issues 
The current prototype was evaluated on a SIP based network. The next step is to 
integrate the prototype with a real IMS system and to extend the prototype for using 
all available IMS functionalities (e.g. Presence Service, Conferencing). Security and 
charging issues are other topics that need more investigation.
