Innovation Key to Mobile Operator Success ICE 2.0 - Mobile Content and Next Generation User Interface 
 
Infocubes unique 3D content experience helps Mobile Operators 
extend their Customer and ARPU Base 
for Smart and Standard Phones on 3G Networks. 
 
User satisfaction is the key to long term customer success. Ease of use and quality of 
mobile content experience are therefore core to the long term success of Mobile 
Operators and Handset Manufacturers alike. As competition increases and 
Smartphones begin to replace legacy handsets established Mobile Operators have to 
retain and extend their lead by offering even higher value, higher quality content 
services. This is what Infocube enables Operators to do easily and cost-effectively, on 
3G Networks, with Infocube ICE 2.0 for Smartphones and ICE LITE 2.0 for Standard 
colour screen phones. 
 
Infocube is what Mobile Operators have been looking for - the ability to deliver 
quality content in an effective manner, with an engaging experience, without spending 
a fortune putting new content infrastructures in place. Infocube offer a 3rd generation 
handset experience suitable for 2G or 3G networks. This enables Mobile Operators to 
get the improved ARPU they need whilst supporting both existing and new customers 
in a cost-effective manner. Infocube ICE 2.0 is ideal for the increasingly powerful 
Smartphones, harnessing their computer and display power for ease of use with high 
functionality, while ICE LITE 2.0 supports a wide range of standard colour screen 
handsets giving users easy content navigation and interaction. 
 
The Infocube front end is a three dimensional user interface that sits within any 
suitable phone, making content navigation and selection easy. Users find what they 
are looking for with just a few spins and clicks. And the 3D interface brings their 
options into the foreground for one-click selection to deliver comprehensive content 
services that are easy to interact with for rocker-controlled or touch-screen phones. 
 
Mobile Operators can white-label the interface for use with existing content 
infrastructure or use Infocube state-of-the-art database and web services software to 
deliver content easily and effectively with a minimum of additional overhead. Such 
new services increase user satisfaction which has a direct correlation with customer 
retention and higher ARPU, thereby reducing churn and increasing profit. 
 
According to Infocube's Founder, Dr Gordon Ross, "Some Mobile Operators have 
spent large sums of money delivering average content services because they have not 
used the latest technologies. Now these investments are in danger of being a handicap 
as more innovative Operators leap-frog obsolete technologies and go straight to state 
of the art solutions for content services exploiting commodity hardware advances." 
 
By providing the Infocube interface and/or content packaging as white-label solutions 
Mobile Operators benefit from years of investment, software development and proven 
deployment, and Infocube benefits by being able to invest in yet more ground-
breaking products and services. "We see this as a win-win for the Mobile Operators 
and Infocube, but the real winners are the Mobile Operator's customers who get 
quality content services they can use and enjoy," says Dr Ross

"Users have expressed dissatisfaction with current Smartphones. They are too 
complex so content services are not taken up. With the inherent computing power of 
smartphones users can get more and Infocube exploits this power for their 3D 
navigation. This and the latest XML and database developments for content 
processing means Mobile Operators deploy quality information services that are an 
increasingly important sources of revenue. With Infocube, Mobile Operators get 
multiple channels of content delivered to their users, in a manner that is easy for users 
to interact with, across 2G or 3G networks, with Standard or Smart phones. Infocube 
content solution have been designed to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn 
and maximise revenue generation opportunities" says Dr Ross. 
 
"For Handset Manufactures there are other benefits. Suddenly the inherent power of 
their devices can be exploited to deliver a better user experience. Ensuring the small 
number of Infocube controls can be easily executed on the Handset, Manufacturers 
are guaranteeing high usability and a degree of future-proofing. And with "Over-The 
-Air" software updating, handset life is suddenly extended making the overall 
Handset package a more attractive proposition for Mobile Operators. This means not 
just more sales, but higher value sales as well! Another win-win-win situation."
