# Spaces in rule name before :
# source compound
# no target defined
# several special chars in expression
My rule 1 :
  source: N [compound]
  target: N A
  rule: s[0] == t[1].stem && s[1][0] != t[0]

# rule defined on several lines

# compound option with spaces inside
# occ pattern have space before and after ,
My rule 2:
  source: N [ compound   ]
  target:     N  ,  A     N        
  rule: >
    s[0] == t[1].stem 
    && s[1][0] != t[0]
